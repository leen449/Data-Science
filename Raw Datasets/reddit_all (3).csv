gaming,Dancing_Gavin,263,"DMC5 has one of the most difficult plats of these two generations, in my opinion.

Catherine has an extremely difficult endgame trophy. I don't remember the exact requirements, but I think it requires you to beat an endgame mode that is procedurally generated and the levels become increasingly more difficult with the last one being absolutely brutal. You have to think REALLY fast and plan several steps ahead while at it to get them done.

Hollow Knight is also pretty difficult, especially if you suck at platformers (like I do). Other platformers, like Celeste and Super Meat Boy, should also be mentioned here. Crash Bandicoot 4 as well, I guess.

I've heard that Crypt of the Necrodancer is very difficult to plat, but haven't tried it myself, so can't comment on that.

Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus requires you to beat the game on the hardest difficulty without dying.

Max Payne 3 was probably the hardest plat I've gotten, but I believe it's actually impossible to do as of now.

I wouldn't look at souls-likes or soulsbourne games for that, because their plats are usually pretty straightforward and not difficult trophy-wise. Gameplay might be hard, but it becomes relatively easy over time."

gaming,TwoBionicknees,3613,"hand made... dude, it's much worse than you are saying. 2 games, wow, they should be $5 each.

How original textures were made. Someone designs them, the software alone to do that is worse. The design is checked and iterated 20 times, 70% of textures for enemies are thrown out as the enemy type is not picked for the final game. AS the game changes through the design process, they change design choices and the textures change again. Shitloads of design, iteration and unused things are done. That's how a game gets made.

This game, they know the texture already, every single choice has been made, zero going down the wrong path or making designs that aren't used are happening. They have the full game, every decision and all they do is take textures and redo them.

A port can use an emulator, which is usually easier because you can then port every game over using an emulator they make because then 95% of the work done to get every title working is done once and can be reused for every game from that platform.

This will take 2% of the effort of making the real game, but they want to charge full price.

Not to mention it would build on the lore of the first game, and that lore was not built to last, which would make it more serious, which again, undermines the whole premise.

Primal was actually a smart second move, but they forgot that making it a smaller game is what made the whole exercise more interesting for everyone. Once it's a full game it must meet that level of quality and safeness. Making them small and risky and yes even a bit janky means the dev team can have some fun with it, and players get to experience something refreshing without having to pay for a full game. 

Seeing what the franchise has turned into it feels like a huge missed opportunity. No doubt it would all feel less stale with wilder games now and then, not to mention some of the ideas from those riskier games might have been worth bringing into the mainline."

In turn they put this on the payment processors that they are only allowed to process legal business. So they need to filter.

In order to filter, they put this on the vendor. That they need to have auditable processes to avoid such transactions occur.

This is nothing new, and have worked quite fine. However things have exploded. It's so ""easy"" to make games and spread them on platforms and monetize nowadays. So the burden has increased on the vendor to vet the games they sell. Some will slip through the cracks of course, and be up for a long time. And since most people who come in contact with those illegal games are actively searching for them, they don't get reported. When they eventually get reported, each step in the chain wants some action plan to be formed in order to prevent this in the future.

Eventually this lands on the vendor, who brings the games to the market. They realize that there's no chance that they can audit every update on a game, it would be too expensive.

gaming,GrinningPariah,5456,"I've been doing a replay of the series from 2 onward, and man the leap in mechanical quality from 4 to 5 is insane. Every Far Cry after the first has added gameplay mechanics, but none added so many as 5 and also, 5 was the last time they didn't feel like a mistake. 

Far Cry 5 gave us: 

* Improved ballistics (and some of the best-feelings in any game) 
* Guns for Hire (aka companions in other games) 
* Planes and real helicopters 
* Garages where you can buy and spawn cars, plus the above 
* Alternate ammo types (other than arrows) 
* Meaningfully new enemies (planes, attack choppers, near-zombies, those guys that can call reinforcements, etc) 
* The entire Challenges system for perk points 
* Ambient puzzles for loot (both in prepper stashes and smaller caches) 
* Better map discovery (losing towers, learning of individual locations by saving people) 
* Dynamic roadblocks and more roaming objectivies
* Safes that need tools and time to crack
* Airdrop fast travel 
* Fucking fly fishing

5 is also probably the hardest Far Cry, at least since 3. And that actually adds a lot in a series that wants you to engage with all these systems. Like, why bother setting traps when you can just shoot every enemy? 

I also think 5 put the most effort into a lot of common elements, like outpost design. Any given outpost is generally pretty good, but the *variety* is amazing. It goes from farming warehouses, to lakeside lodges, to mountaintop observatories. And those are meaningfully different to approach. 

And for me at least, 5 did the best job of balancing the tone. Far Cry's always been a little bit silly, and it's also always been about people doing awful things to each other. And I think by leaning into the madness that is America, the ""I don't know whether to laugh or cry"" of the news stories you here, it does a better job of walking that line. Or maybe I'm a little more familiar with the ways of rural America than I am with Nepal or Indonesian island chains, and seeing these places burnt, bloodied, or ready for war, it hits home in a way the others didn't."

1. Price is high because they still sell and more money = better, if someone buys the game, NICE! if not, so what?  
2. ""brand value"" which means that if they show the previous game drops in price, they think that people are just going to wait for price drop and it keeps the brand ""premium""  
3. To push players into newer titles because due to point 2. if new game and old game are same price, people are going to buy the new game instead

But it would be not fine to access information that is supposed to be hidden from the player. Then it could be quickly on the pipeline for a wallhack. (At least from the view of the anti cheat)

Those are unmistakably James Gunn movies; he's even said he had full creative control. Or take Taika Waititi’s Thor entries; love them or hate them, they clearly bear his unique voice. Even the Russo brothers’ Marvel films feel tonally and stylistically different from the rest of the MCU.

You can also look at Joss Whedon's contributions. While Age of Ultron had its issues, both of his Avengers films still carry his signature writing style.

To me, Marvel projects are really a case-by-case situation, shaped by a range of factors. Even this year, Thunderbolts felt like it had its own identity, while Cap 4 came off as pretty by-the-numbers."

movies,FrameworkisDigimon,3066,"Stories come in two basic modes: comedy and drama. (tragedy I prefer to mean something else)

You can fuse these two basic modes with various genres or you can treat them just based on their own terms. 

Comedy tends to be merged with other genres when it comes to film. The most famous two examples are romcoms and action comedies. If you want to define ""pure"" comedy as comedy without genre elements, then I guess we're going to have talk about things like Bean or Mr Bean's Holiday. 

Drama stands by itself without genre elements to a much greater extent *at first glance*. The reality is that the straight action film is really an action drama, we just don't voice that it's in a dramatic mode because we treat drama as a default. This isn't an inherent condition but it's the current condition.

The fact drama is often treated like a genre rather than a mode is might be why the dramedy exists. You infuse a comedy plot with dramatic conventions and voila, a dramedy. Wikipedia calls such films comedy-dramas.

This is what I think Poehler means by pure comedy. It's films whose only mode is comedy, regardless of genre additions, with no dramatic mode. EEAAO and Birdman are both listed as comedy-dramas on Wikipedia which should obviously make sense. The King's Speech is introduced as an historical drama film and has no references to comedy at all. I think this is a more natural concept for pure comedy than carving out something like Baby's Day Out because it's an ""adventure comedy"" or National Security because it's an action comedy.*

So, where does this leave black comedy? Well, black comedy is just a kind of comedy.

*Mind you, most action comedies tend to exist in a drama mode... normally it's an action movie but with more quips. Or, in the case of EEAAO specifically random as fuck shit just stuck in as visual gags. Some instructive examples might be to compare and contrast Shanghai Noon and Shanghai Knights."

It’s been made worse with the popularity of MMA in my opinion so now it’s that weird dancing plus MMA moves.

movies,East_Requirement_508,209,"You're thinking too deep into it lmao.

99% of race jokes are stereotypes, aka a form of referential humor. It doesn't matter if the stereotype is actually true or not, it just matters that you know of said stereotype. Many stereotypes are actually statistically false, and many non stereotypes should be stereotypes because of how insanely true they are.

For example, ""white people can't tolerate spicy food"" is a stereotype. It's not true really, whites don't have some sort of genetic intolerance to spice, and some of the most tasteful dishes are from europe, but if I made a joke about that, it's ""funny"" because it references that stereotype.

Now let's take, ""business owner is a white job"". This is not funny, because it's not a stereotype. Business owners may be predominantly white statistically, but if I made a reference to that, nobody is going to laugh.

Telling racist jokes technically has nothing to do with whether or not someone is actually racist, even a someone saying a racist joke in a malicious manner, they could just be saying it to be a dick, and they don't actually believe what they say, and someone joking about it even in a tolerable way can secretly be racist as hell, but knows how to properly mask it off as jokes. And you'd never know, hell the guy telling the jokes probably doesn't even know.

The only way you can be sure someone isn't racist, is if they don't get the joke at all, meaning they don't get the stereotype/never heard of it, meaning it's impossible for them to believe it. But that practically doesn't exist in modern society anymore, with how mainstream race humor has become. Even someone who didn't understand to begin with will now be influenced by the jokes, to the point they might start believing stereotypes, or at least thinking about them.

Now the reason why it's ""funny"" is because it's supposed to be ""offensive"". Race is seen as a taboo topic in society (at least at one point), so making any reference to a possible stereotype is funny because ""you're not supposed to do that"", similar to why potty humor is funny for kids, because usually parents tell the kids that talking about such topics plainly is ""rude"".

This is what separates stereotype from statistic. A statistic that has to do with race, would be more true than any stereotype, but isn't funny because it's not seen as ""taboo"" to talk about that statistic. It's basically dollar store dark humor. People make dark humor jokes for the shock value and because it's ""morally wrong"" to make that joke.

You could argue race humor has devolved into just people finding anything that even mentions race funny, even without the stereotype. For example, someone randomly just saying ""because he's black"" to a non stereotype, but that's a conversation for another day."

For all Trump’s bluster about a third term and his bitching about mail in voting, I have never been too worried about him cancelling the elections. Might be my general optimism, surprising given how pessimistic my view of the economy is, but even with the Republican control of the court, cancelling an election wouldn’t even get Alito’s vote. Thomas is a possibility, though.

The courts didn’t take Trump’s bullshit last time and they still won’t. It would take a military coup for Trump to stop the elections and that would be a step way over the line for even his sycophants in Congress and the cabinet. They aren’t true believers in Trump, they just want power and money. A coup would burn this country to the ground. 

There is also a significant possibility Trump doesn’t survive his term. The man is old and not in the best of shape with some medical issues that seem to be getting worse. And the coming economic issues are about to cause him a lot of stress, not because he’ll do all he can to solve it but because he’s going to see so much negative coverage on Fox News.

I don’t claim to know the internal reasoning of them for all of this, correlation is not causation of course. But I have a feeling their business decisions might be affected by the trade policies of the Trump administration.

politics,BCMakoto,3914,"The bigger problem is that Democrats are *not* a good answer to the problems the younger generations face at the moment. This trend of young Gen Z men moving a bit to the right is applicable in a *lot* of western countries, but they are usually balanced by a lot of young Gen Z women moving to the left.

The problem is that even Democrats are more concerned with the status quo and corporational wellfare than the Gen Z voter. The job market is getting worse, job prospects are getting worse, finances are stagnating, rents and healthcare prices soaring, family planning is becoming more difficult, climate change sucks. It's all cracking under the weight of corporate welfare so that Meta *and* Zuckerberg can get their 17th tax break this century. Democrats are better than Republicans, but they aren't making the situation better in perceivable, day-to-day ways. Biden was *objectively* better than Trump, but you have to remember he oversaw Covid, which was a shit time alltogether. That perception sticks.

Then as the Democrats come in, they don't actually change all that much. The economy is still working on a nominal level, but the issues Gen Z and Millennials have don't get addressed on a fundamental level. Apparently Trump can break the entire system in 9 months and institute a full-on authoritarian playbook for the rest of his life, but Democrats don't manage a single, big system change that benefits around 40% of the population in their most important, family-starting age for four years.

It's starting to hit a lot of people, especially young men suffering from the loneliness epidemic, and so attitudes are becoming bleaker. In other countries, this swing is *somewhat* balanced by young women and liberal men moving to further left parties while young, disillusioned men vote far-right parties.  But that just doesn't exist in US politics. It is either the far right, or neo-liberalist corporate welfare. ""Left"" doesn't exist the way it does in other countries. Centre and far-right currently make up the spectrum. Just look at how much Schumer and other Democrats are refusing to endorse Mamdani. They *hate* actual left-wing socialism or liberalism. It is corporatism all the way down.

And that system leads to surveys where 25-30% of youngsters say they want a ""strong, authoritarian leader."" They don't actually want a *dictator.* Who they want is someone who can cut through the layers of bullshit and do what Trump does, but that actually makes their life better and makes jobs, makes healthcare affordable and puts housing and family planning in reach."

Personally I see links between South African apartheid Christian Nationalists, KKK Christianity, Religion as State or a tool of colonial conquest, the German Nazi Parties ""Positive Christianity"" neo-nazi ideology. To me, the Christian nationalism of the CNP, the Family, or the Devos family is more related to the above than traditional mainstream protestantism or Catholicism  in America. Theres even eugenicist who believe in non-religious calvanist predestination being promoted in places like the WAPO and holding conferences. It may just be my experience is from a time when Christian nationalism wasn't something that was talked about and since the 2000s it seems to have become mainstream and is taking over existing churches even though the people pushing Christian nationalism seem very much like White Nationalists. I did notice an odd phenomenon where propaganda from South African Neo-nazis/Christian Nationalists seems to have been being mainstreamed into right-wing media with the attribution to Neo-nazis removed over the last twenty years or so.

There definitely something going on with the CNP and GOP here.

Edit: I have no idea really but I think in the Bush Administration there was a smallish cabal of crusades larping nazis that developed over the course of GWOT and also a handful of lawyer criminals that were key to the bush Administrations use of various crimes against humanity. The lawyer criminals like Ron DeSantis have gone on to become very influential, and in the absence of excusing crimes against humanity, they would have been low performing JAG officers relative to the whole. There is definitely a strain of today's nazi that views crusades larping as a key to power(Hegseth, Flynn Gorka) and may have worked with Russia to continue the Syrian civil war_Yemen for the purposes of driving human migration to areas and doing the whole russian political subversion thing. I was in Paris the night before the attack at the Eagles of death metal concert and I did notice the general situation seemed enflamed in a way that would make the likely of something happening higher, but that was just a personal observation similar to what I observedin Ukraine in 2015. I can't rule out that Iraq was basically motivated by this and corporations like Halliburton profiteering, encircling Iran, and securing oil. Just the money a Halliburton subsidiary made off over charging to provide food at bases in Iraq was pretty significant. All those bush era guys getting together with people like Steven Bannon, finding a figurehead like trump and creating a political mob with unwaverable support in a divided electorate and using usung sine of those intel torture people to sow chaos to use as a ladder via verious operations like qanon and stop the steal would be pretty wild if it did happen. 

I personally think it's weird that the trump family is so involved in housing segregation that there's a woody Guthrie song about. 

One of those two ships in 7th fleet that crashed in trumps first term was diverted from a maintenance period with red-lined navigation equipment to probably the busiest maritime shipping area in the world to back up a mean tweet to Kim Jung Un, I had heard, I think. 

I can't rule out that one of the reasons trump has been ordering weird and reckless military actions since 2017 is that he is an amoral moron using cool sounding raids, erc to get positive feedback from a tv militarism obsessed fan base. Not in this economy.

Just based on personal observation from say 2000 to 2021, I noticed that under the bush administration is they started hiring contractors for military job, massively reducing training in some areas in a way that resulted in a slow loss of institutional knowledge over the years in a way reminesent of how the gop starves the government and then complains things don't work so we should privatize everything of turn it fascist. Just the strain of endless wars had a similar effect on the military over that time. 

I also noticed a similar reliance of mercenary forces that are the American equivalent of the Wagner group over the years. They paid triple canopy(Erik Prince now) to provide parameter security for bases in Iraq especially after a really bad Svied attack on the gate of the base in Ramadi Iraq. These triple canopy shitbags then somehow got a bunch of Ugandan to put in base parameter and internal security guards as human shields possibly in an abusive human labor trafficking type situation. It seems dishonorable generally to use Ugandans as humans shields and they were all generally nice people probably being exploited by dirtbag mercenaries. Triple Canopy has people in the federal protective services within DHS and some betrayed their agencies for doge takeovers. Russell Vought has said he plans to use the military against the American people and bringing mercs in through the poorly regulated DHS federal protective services subcomponent. They have been unquestionably Federal Protective Services agents in the ""ICE"" task force thats been terrorizing everyone. I saw a video where ice agents had been pointing a gun at a guy following them until a guy came over and deescalated and said he was FPS and had an FPS patch/badge on. The same guy was masked and holding up the kind of shield thats used for entering a space or if a shooter is suspected, and he was being a rude clown displaying a totally different demeanor while masked. There could be something like what putin did to secure power in Russia going on. Vought talks about using the military in videos you can find on propublica and democracy now he also mentions ""they failed to pass an amendment"" and I don't know what hes talking about exactly. At least by 2020 I would not have said there was any way the US military as a force would betray the American people for a fascist dictatorship and I still don't. The US military is just microcosm of American society. By the end of trumps term I noticed some of the stupidity Bonhoefler talked about popping up, but much less that in civil society at time. This is why I think Vought is bringing in mercs and also why dhs is quartering on military bases around the country, in my opinion. Also I wouldn't put it past tom Homan to exploit the martyrdom of Charlie Kirk to bring in a trump youth force from the tpusa base. Homan had been attending tpusa events and hyping ice while using a few white nationalist/ dogwhistle and propagandizing peoples kids with violent rhetoric. 

If I had to guess they radicalized a kid into a staged attack in Butler, PA then blew his head and did something similar to bring about the tragic murder of Charlie Kirk.

One thing that stuck out to me after the Butler PA attack was the use of disinformation and spectacle and a distraction with an example being two minutes of hate propaganda focused on the secret service to a audience primed to feel anger, fear, and distrust at women. Same thing after the tragic murder only this time the FBI director and others were a part of the operation. The secret to their success is being totally amoral pieces of shit like the German nazi party.
