movies,Relevant_Session5987,643,"I feel like Marvel often gets unfairly stereotyped based on its weaker films, especially those that came out of troubled collaborations. But when people talk about Marvel, why is there so little mention of standout projects like the Guardians of the Galaxy films? Those are unmistakably James Gunn movies; he's even said he had full creative control. Or take Taika Waititi’s Thor entries; love them or hate them, they clearly bear his unique voice. Even the Russo brothers’ Marvel films feel tonally and stylistically different from the rest of the MCU.

You can also look at Joss Whedon's contributions. While Age of Ultron had its issues, both of his Avengers films still carry his signature writing style.

To me, Marvel projects are really a case-by-case situation, shaped by a range of factors. Even this year, Thunderbolts felt like it had its own identity, while Cap 4 came off as pretty by-the-numbers."

movies,FrameworkisDigimon,3066,"Stories come in two basic modes: comedy and drama. (tragedy I prefer to mean something else)

You can fuse these two basic modes with various genres or you can treat them just based on their own terms. 

Comedy tends to be merged with other genres when it comes to film. The most famous two examples are romcoms and action comedies. If you want to define ""pure"" comedy as comedy without genre elements, then I guess we're going to have talk about things like Bean or Mr Bean's Holiday. 

Drama stands by itself without genre elements to a much greater extent *at first glance*. The reality is that the straight action film is really an action drama, we just don't voice that it's in a dramatic mode because we treat drama as a default. This isn't an inherent condition but it's the current condition.

The fact drama is often treated like a genre rather than a mode is might be why the dramedy exists. You infuse a comedy plot with dramatic conventions and voila, a dramedy. Wikipedia calls such films comedy-dramas.

This is what I think Poehler means by pure comedy. It's films whose only mode is comedy, regardless of genre additions, with no dramatic mode. EEAAO and Birdman are both listed as comedy-dramas on Wikipedia which should obviously make sense. The King's Speech is introduced as an historical drama film and has no references to comedy at all. I think this is a more natural concept for pure comedy than carving out something like Baby's Day Out because it's an ""adventure comedy"" or National Security because it's an action comedy.*

So, where does this leave black comedy? Well, black comedy is just a kind of comedy.

*Mind you, most action comedies tend to exist in a drama mode... normally it's an action movie but with more quips. Or, in the case of EEAAO specifically random as fuck shit just stuck in as visual gags. Some instructive examples might be to compare and contrast Shanghai Noon and Shanghai Knights."

99% of race jokes are stereotypes, aka a form of referential humor. It doesn't matter if the stereotype is actually true or not, it just matters that you know of said stereotype. Many stereotypes are actually statistically false, and many non stereotypes should be stereotypes because of how insanely true they are.

For example, ""white people can't tolerate spicy food"" is a stereotype. It's not true really, whites don't have some sort of genetic intolerance to spice, and some of the most tasteful dishes are from europe, but if I made a joke about that, it's ""funny"" because it references that stereotype.

Now let's take, ""business owner is a white job"". This is not funny, because it's not a stereotype. Business owners may be predominantly white statistically, but if I made a reference to that, nobody is going to laugh.

Telling racist jokes technically has nothing to do with whether or not someone is actually racist, even a someone saying a racist joke in a malicious manner, they could just be saying it to be a dick, and they don't actually believe what they say, and someone joking about it even in a tolerable way can secretly be racist as hell, but knows how to properly mask it off as jokes. And you'd never know, hell the guy telling the jokes probably doesn't even know.

The only way you can be sure someone isn't racist, is if they don't get the joke at all, meaning they don't get the stereotype/never heard of it, meaning it's impossible for them to believe it. But that practically doesn't exist in modern society anymore, with how mainstream race humor has become. Even someone who didn't understand to begin with will now be influenced by the jokes, to the point they might start believing stereotypes, or at least thinking about them.

Now the reason why it's ""funny"" is because it's supposed to be ""offensive"". Race is seen as a taboo topic in society (at least at one point), so making any reference to a possible stereotype is funny because ""you're not supposed to do that"", similar to why potty humor is funny for kids, because usually parents tell the kids that talking about such topics plainly is ""rude"".

This is what separates stereotype from statistic. A statistic that has to do with race, would be more true than any stereotype, but isn't funny because it's not seen as ""taboo"" to talk about that statistic. It's basically dollar store dark humor. People make dark humor jokes for the shock value and because it's ""morally wrong"" to make that joke.

You could argue race humor has devolved into just people finding anything that even mentions race funny, even without the stereotype. For example, someone randomly just saying ""because he's black"" to a non stereotype, but that's a conversation for another day."

movies,Beave__,83,"Fun fact: Costner wanted to do an English accent but the director thought it was terrible (correctly) and said don't do it. However, Costner persevered and started to talk in the English accent in his scenes, as well as around set, staying in (terrible) character. There was something of a power struggle, as Costner's fame was peaking around this time.

What makes it into the film is roughly half Costner's shite accent and half American accent - with quite a lot somewhere in between. Inconsistently performed and edited. 

The worst of both worlds."

movies,MotherInteraction465,244,"Very well said and I do agree . I watched it recently and it blew me away in a sense that not many movies do , its deeply engaging and kinda in a crunch cause so much happens in such a short span of time . 

I watched his acting and it just stands out , among countless films that I have seen . I saw a clip of him in some interview and he mentioned that he worked around 7 years with Nolan through the batman films , and through out the years he only got 2 notes and how they communicated about the role that he was performing . He is a masterclass in acting (and in terms of directing I'd also say Nolan has done a lot of fascinating and influential work for the industry as well) . 

After this I watched a series called Slow Horses in which Gary Oldman is brilliant . Among his most engaging roles as well , just cant get enough of it , altho the series in itself is not THAT great , but it is good ."
