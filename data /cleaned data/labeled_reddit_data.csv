Ghost Recon Wildlands - Used my avatar Sgt Nick Fury from comics with eye patch and cigar. Then several outfits depending on area, mission and time of day.

gaming,0.33,"“But the thing I hated the most is the typical Capcom style, end game where they decide to throw all the enemies at you and the kitchen sink. While I think the combat is passable, it just isn't fun to the point where I wanna do it again and again and again in a short time span. It just became annoying and at that point I just kept saying to myself, for the love of God, just gimme the final boss and end it already.”

And this is why I’m not even going to even attempt this game. It’s truly mind boggling that they made the game more combat focused yet failed to deliver an enjoyable combat experience. I’ve yet to see a review where combat wasn’t described as basically unenjoyable. Then you combine that with enemies being thrown at you and the end result is frustration that I simply do not want to deal with.

This is rarely accomplished in a singular pass. In the hands of an artist the machine is artistic, in the hands of a random person it really isn't going to make anything worth seeing. 

I think a great example of something we could create right now would be the Lies of P intro cutscene. Go watch if you haven't played the game or seen it before. Its a wonderfully done bit of artistry by the studio and I guarantee you could make something just like it with AI right now today. 

Actually being honest I DISLIKE the term AI being applied to this tech. Its an appropriation of theoretical technology terminology that is highly misleading.

movies,12.12,"They are sort of antithetical approaches to model building so I don't think so.  
  
Data scaling isn't all that there is to model improvement. As we develop this technology we encounter problems. How those problems get solved depends on each case. For example a problem might require just more training data. More data = better model = better results = no more problem. We see this in say Qwen Edit vs Qwen Edit Plus. The later is MUCH better at replicating a specific appearance. Same architecture but better data = better model in a similar profile. Sometimes instead what you need is an architecture upgrade. 

At ChatGPT levels its VERY expensive to make major changes to it. At Qwen's level its still expensive but you can iterate \~80 times and still be cheaper than ChatGPT is. With Qwen's price level you can afford to experiment and learn where you need changes efficiently. The result will be that at Qwen V83 it will be much better than whatever ChatGPT6 is like. 

The major problem with the John Wick approach is that 4 movies is not a large enough data set and they don't really have a good underlying architecture. That's LORA level input, they need a base model first. The visual stuff they can get from the image generation tech, but they'll need a good LLM for writing stories. As far as I'm aware no current LLM can write a story beyond very short length that has anything approaching real cohesion. The tech simply isn't there yet. This is probably possible, but I'm guessing its going to be 5-10 years or longer before you can quickly train a movie lora on a small library and then produce a coherent sequel that's even remotely worth watching. They were frankly stupid and out of touch to try it right now.",0

DDL can go big, go quiet and nuanced and everywhere in between.  His acting in TWBB and Gangs are so different than The Boxer and Ballad of Jack and Rose, to The Bounty and My Beautiful Launderette to Unbearable Lightness.  He is my favorite actor of all time.  The only actors who are close for me in past 40 years or so are pre 2000s DeNiro and PSH.  The one thing these two are better at are comedies.  Maybe DDL could but just haven't seen it happen..

Having said that, I do think there is something deliberately off-putting about Alex basically learning black magic.

If they actually did it, it would cost many, many billions to rehire and pay settlements to every RIF’d employee. Courts could be compromised, but this would be hard to find a legal route out of, even for the slimiest, most corrupt judges out there.
