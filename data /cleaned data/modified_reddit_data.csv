gaming,8.45,The Xexiest Box
gaming,14.21,Myst.
gaming,0.56,The legend of a player casting a fire spell on the creator in game and killed him 😭
gaming,14.45,"It was still fun years after it came out as a pirated PC game download lmaoooo

The only part I was like ???? bruh why??? was the stupid part where you have to fight literal giant ants in a VR world or something. That was painful."
gaming,0.85,"Ah it sounded interesting aside from the ""single player"" thing. I tend to dislike single player games."
gaming,9.21,"Looking at the OP's history, like wtf. Dude is farming upvotes or what? Also, it seems post about XBox dying is a good way to farm karma."
gaming,8.95,Minecraft
gaming,14.15,"I had a castle that I placed the evening they unlocked housing placement. It was immediately outside of the little path coming out of Deceit.

All of my neighbors had castles and decorated them so nicely and mine was literally just a storage warehouse...

It was a grand old time."
gaming,9.97,Yeah but I'm saying in reference to all these people for the past few weeks saying that Microsoft is just shutting down Xbox
gaming,2.54,"I don’t agree that that is what modern PvP mmo players want. But do agree that is why these games continually fail.

Modern PvP players haven’t seen a karma/bounty/murderer system with penalties"
gaming,5.87,"Very glad to hear that, considering I really liked the original too!

Now I facepalm at myself for why I didn't try it out during early access"
gaming,10.06,This was a freakin' great one.
gaming,14.78,"Oh man, that must've been *ages* ago. I would guess maybe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Or, it's very possible it was Super Mario Kart (the first one). Man...I've been gaming for over three decades now. And no signs of stopping any time soon :D"
gaming,12.58,"Why do ya'll keep saying this? New Xbox consoles are in development.

gaming,1.72,Yes.
gaming,1.41,Goty is going to be a bloodbath! What an amazing year for gaming!
gaming,1.72,"Expedition 33 reportily only cost around $25 million to make, and it blows a lot of bigger budget games out of the water."
gaming,13.42,"Right? I went the other day and for like 7.50, fed the whole fam for lunch. Unheard of anywhere else these days."

gaming,2.19,The combat is not even close to Sekiro. It’s incredibly easy once you figure out the rock paper scissors. It just gets boring from there.
gaming,8.22,"Let's gooooo!

Been there since the early access release :]"
gaming,9.94,"Great game once i gotten the chance to play it on PC, never had access to PC gaming till late 90s and being in love with Uncharted Waters on Genesis i always wondered how much more powerful these type of game would be on DoS machines as a kid. This game showed me the possibilities once i gotten my own PC for sure."
gaming,10.06,This is impossible.  Nothing will hit her.
gaming,0.29,Bro is skibidi ohio labubu 💀😭 sigma
gaming,0.85,"That's because that game was cheeks.

Acceptable games to remember fondly in that era were Legends of Kesmai, Ultima online, EverQuest, Shadowbane, Ashron's Call, Dark Age of Camelot. Maybe early Star Wars Galaxies too but that was on the tail end of the 1st gen era and it humped the bunk with the ngu changes pretty bad."
gaming,8.64,"So, what changes from the early access to main release?"
gaming,12.58,"No, they're pivoting to new systems. They've already announced the next Xbox is in development using AMD and there's also the portable/handheld Xbox Ally or whatever that's coming soon.

https://youtu.be/VOCtRanwXrA?si=1j5jsEn3bqswU9dZ"
gaming,8.1,"Cool, I'll continue sailing the high seas."
gaming,1.35,I already told you I don't want a gimmick console. It's weird that you do.
gaming,0.01,k.
gaming,3.82,Give it 6 months dude. Zero reason to rush and buy it right now. It’ll be half the price with most of the kinks worked out by then
gaming,2.09,Everquest
gaming,1.78,Great point actually.
gaming,12.99,BOOMBLOX TOURNAMENT!
gaming,6.98,I wish more games innovated like this did. It was an ambitious game ahead of its time and for the most part delivered.
gaming,12.2,"I knew something was weird about this! I almost got my hands on one at Sam’s Club a couple weeks ago. It was super heavily discounted. I checked out and nobody brought it to me, so I went to the member’s counter and they told me it was already out of stock :("
gaming,8.98,"I honestly don’t understand why there needs to be communication at all. The game speaks for itself, doesn’t it? why do we need a bunch of placating words written by devs in the first place? "
gaming,9.72,"It wasn't very extensive.

They took Cloud out and put Balthier in his place, so that substory got rewritten a little. Other than that there were two bad jobs added, which... honestly, who gives a shit. They were total gimmicks. I'm not going to lose any sleep over Dark Knight, which had a grand total of TWO MOVES because it was never intended to be anything other than a boss."
gaming,3.96,"I've put 10,000 hours into OSRS and I still confused this game for OERS"
gaming,7.67,Bank!
gaming,11.87,Kal vas flam
gaming,7.3,Oh please
gaming,2.95,OG Minecraft
gaming,15.07,I had a 5900x and 7900xtx and have had worsening performance over time.
gaming,11.32,"I miss this game so much you have no idea. Never liked WoW so i went to other ganes like Redmoon Online, Priston Tale, Ragnarok, Cabal Online, Atlantica Online, etc."
gaming,0.8,Probably Fortnite. Or maybe Pokemon sword. I can’t quite remember
gaming,4.88,"Starcraft 2, It was one of my first games"
gaming,9.72,"It didn't have a job system.

I do agree that Triangle Strategy was good (even if the voice direction was legitimately terrible) though."
gaming,3.82,"Because what Microsoft did with the series S and X was one of the worst business decisions they ever made to the point they may not even make another console? You’re basically having to optimize every single game for two seperate platforms, adding a ton of development time for very little payoff. 

It also defeats the entire purpose of the switch, which was the marry their portable and home console lines. Having a seperate home based console makes absolutely zero sense"
gaming,0.93,"Jedi Survivor, Cyberpunk DLC+2.0, Diablo 4, FF16, Lies of P, Hogwarts Legacy, Octopath Traveller 2, Dave the Diver and Armored Core 6."
gaming,10.06,"I'm more partical to ""They played us like a damn fiddle!"""
gaming,10.66,"I know I’m in the minority but in so stoked for Outer Worlds 2 every statement out of the team has me more and more convinced they legit listened to feedback and have done their best to fix what didn’t work and expand on what made Outer Worlds unique. More factions, more quest lines, flaws give much more unique and interesting effects, the combat is smoother, while still having the zany Uber corporate farcical humor and the build focused dialogue options that made the game a blast (can’t wait to see how they top being so dumb you can fly your ship into the sun)."
gaming,9.26,"You are 100% correct.


Losing the lead writer for ME1 was a big blow. There was a plan, and then they abandoned it and just hodgepodged the trilogy together. 


Honestly, kinda like the star wars sequels"
gaming,9.12,He obviously meant KCD2 because we're talking about games that came out this year.
gaming,11.83,REEEEEED FACTION!!!!!!
gaming,9.72,"> But yes, I would like a new game instead of FFT being re-re-re-re-released.

The last semi-stable release of FFT was 20 years ago, and that version sucked.

It hasn't been playable on anything other than a very specific patch of Android that went out of date and won't boot a month after it was released, for nearly 13 years.

There hasn't been a GOOD version of FFT since its original release in 1997, since the PSP barely ran at 15 FPS (and the original game was specifically cut down scope-wise from Tactics Ogre in order to hit 60 FPS on the PSX).

I know you want to go ""GRRR RE-RELEASE BAD"" but FFT hasn't been playable in 25 fucking years."
gaming,9.99,"Probably Giana Sisters, Bubble Bobble or Defender of the Crown."
gaming,6.69,WOW.
gaming,3.82,I don’t agree with that in the slightest
gaming,12.17,"But they did! After the original vanilla Xbox, it was:

* Three-Sixty
* One
* Series

/s"
gaming,3.82,Regardless of technical specs it punches way above its weight in comparison to the deck. We’ve seen a fair amount of games run well on the switch already that the deck can barely handle.
gaming,0.66,"For the best graphics and connection tho, cloud streaming gamepass ain’t it."
gaming,0.24,The world might be falling apart but we are in the golden era of video games
gaming,11.89,"Tactics Ogre has been my favorite for a while…. But I’ve been waiting for a chance to get FFT. So, can’t wait to play it for the first time."
gaming,9.09,Makes sense. If they're de-listing it then it's better to get some money for it rather than nothing.
gaming,12.74,Pokémon Blue
gaming,5.66,I played 80 hours of the EA. Can’t wait to do a new save and sink even more into this game
gaming,0.61,"Fuck it, go straight from 360 to Xbox 5. Take THAT Sony."
gaming,4.03,"is 3rd zone Theseus and the Minotaur? that was a serious wall for me back when the game came out, took a while for me to get past them the first time at all, much less consistently. Hades2 is not as straightforward in pathing so you don’t have to fight the same bosses every time though, at least that’s my understanding"
gaming,0.8,Probably PES
gaming,8.08,Pokemon Platinum
gaming,10.44,No sassy Katherine from KCD2? Blasphemous 
gaming,2.17,"modern MMO pvp players just want free reign to kill and troll others without having a system that ""punishes"" them for that style of game.  And that's why every last pvp-based MMORPG has failed."
gaming,0.4,GOTY gonna be a war zone this year
gaming,14.12,Either 5 or 10. 6 is just a weird number.
gaming,9.91,Hot dog and drink at Costco is essential. $1.50 since 1985.
gaming,5.84,"no, character eyelash details and grass leaves details take more priority."
gaming,1.36,Narcist Prince on Super Punch Out on SNES. The way he says ouch when you knock him down is classic 😂
gaming,9.12,"Oh man, did you manage to avoid playing any Hades 2 until now?"
gaming,6.72,"100% deserves 10/10 reviews. It's bigger and better than Hades, which was one of my favorite games."
gaming,12.25,"It being open world would be a game changer. If they made a sequel, I would certainly transact funds to purchase it."
gaming,13.64,Eeeooowww!
gaming,8.64,I just wanted to be cheeky. :(
gaming,7.89,Go back to Pac-Man - the classic “eiweiweiweiweiw-wuh-wu”
gaming,13.49,Yeah they would come out at night and wreak havoc
gaming,7.94,Had to be MGS2 on the ps2
gaming,14.12,"I find a lot of Sony games get a lot more leeway for their open world design than maybe they should. 

Spider-Man 2's side content is terrible and generic, far worse than any Ubisoft open world in the last few years, and yet it still got praised to high heaven."
gaming,1.52,Thought the performance was fine Randy
gaming,0.09,"People complained about Hades 1’s difficulty, I’m sure they’ll do the same about Hades 2 as well. Some people just really hate dying in a game, even if it’s an integral part of the gameplay and story experience, like it is in Hades"
gaming,1.74,I fell of silksong! Found it too hard. Exp 33 was amazing! Yep loved the first ghosts can’t wait for the 2nd one
gaming,2.15,Where have you been? Welcome back to society
gaming,12.43,"I actually played all of Personas 3-5, so it's not even a JRPG thing. It's just that Metaphor in particular didn't really hit for me."
gaming,13.49,Only the brave ventured out to the Brit graveyard to grind those skeletons.
gaming,13.6,"Link -OOT, the “hhhnnnggtsss” as his knee caps shatter after falling 1000 feet"
gaming,9.08,It was either Oblivion or Mass Effect.
gaming,6.88,2023 had three separate games that would’ve won this year pretty easily. And it had bangers in pretty much every genre.
gaming,5.17,"Copilot is installing itself on my pc now every single day. I never asked for it, I've turned off auto updates, I don't use Edge. I uninstall and it's back the next day.
I bought a new one SSD today and will be installing Linux and ditch Windows as my main. Fuck Microsoft with all their bullshit"
gaming,6.97,I'll check it out in a year I guess...
gaming,1.31,Yeah a gem
gaming,8.4,"Random mob \#5 on the Witcher 3 when you blast them off a cliff with Aard (force push.)  

Its just a Wilhelm scream."
gaming,0.73,Ninja turtles NES
gaming,12.92,"Wilds doesn’t deserve it 


Whilst it’s a good game, it’s hollow and empty beneath the surface"
gaming,11.0,"I’ve heard it said that the kind of people who play metaphor tend to like JRPGs and would give expedition 33 a genuine chance.

But the kind of people who like Expedition 33 tend to judge other games on how bad they are at being expedition 33 to the point the devs at Sandfall literally had to post statements to their fandom to stop attacking other Jrpgs that they themselves respect and are inspired by.

So your comment makes sense."
gaming,6.44,[ALL OF THEM?!](https://youtu.be/biX-jh_BNEI?si=3VJlDGPBxGKO6cLD)
gaming,6.87,I am beyond thrilled that full release is finally here. I played a small handful of runs when early access first opened and wanted to save the rest for now.
gaming,8.08,And people that pay 90 Dollars
gaming,0.88,They always forget about Tibia feelsbadman
gaming,6.51,"as someone who has played ac shadows and tsushima, i 100% agree lol."
gaming,18.83,"Costco place a value on the space in their stores.

If they've decided to stop selling Xbox completely, because they think sales will fall and make it uneconomical after the price increase, then it makes sense to clear out that section of their stores and warehouses and use it for something else. 

Amazon do this too. If you follow prices on CamelCamelCamel sometimes you'll see the price fall significantly over the course of a day or two. That means that it's the last one or two of this item on a pallet and Amazon is short of warehouse space. Sometimes you can get things at below their cost - effectively Amazon is paying you to free up the space in the warehouse for them so they can use it to sell something more profitable.

In the case of Xbox at Costco, it's quite possible that Costco weren't making an significant amount of money on them, but it Xbox seen as a ""[anchor product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchor_tenant)"" that drew people to the store. When the console was first launched and there were shortages you would see posts on here, ""my wife found me an Xbox"" - I bet people were going in every week to check for them, and also doing their other shopping any the same time."
gaming,0.88,"Every body talks about UO and never about my boy Tibia.

Tibia gang rise up!"
gaming,10.98,"I always loved the crit and death noises from Final Fantasy Tactics.  
It was so satisfying to move behind an opponent and hear that crunch>wail sequence."
gaming,11.72,"I have been playing Ruins & Riches and its derivatives recently. They are essentially a series of modded versions of Ultima Online where the whole thing is converted into a single player sandbox RPG with a bunch of interesting systems and a new world map. They have surprisingly deep exploration as well, as there are a bunch of mysteries and secrets to discover in them as you progress.

I *really* recommend them if you are feeling nostalgic. Nothing will recreate the social settings of those old games in the oversaturated market we have now, but having the old school sensibilities makes for some really fun play."
gaming,11.91,I played the early access like it was a full time job when it first launched. I put about 35 hours in the first week and then shelved it until full release because I wanted to just start fresh and experience the full game. I am deliriously excited for tomorrow.
gaming,6.66,Did a quick check and Ghost of Tsushima had an 83 Metacritic from critics (user review average it's way higher at 92 though). The sequel has to be better in order to get a nomination. We'll see in a few days.
gaming,0.36,Hadeez nuts
gaming,6.44,Nah that was a powerful scene
gaming,5.87,The games that came out and still coming out man!
gaming,3.03,Subnautica probably
gaming,11.04,Feel like this will launch straight into game pass by the time it gets to Xbox.
gaming,12.17,I'm absolutely convinced Supergiant is one of the best studios operating today. Banger after banger.
gaming,11.79,How is it compared to Mario kart world ?
gaming,13.42,Well look at this Rockerfeller!
gaming,10.25,"The room 3, Myst... if ya like puzzles"
gaming,6.84,"Diablo 3 


Also seek an attorney"
gaming,9.13,I’m just not a Nintendo dork. My switch 2 is basically an expensive paper weight. All the games that have come out have been boring and shit ( like 3 games )
gaming,10.75,Mafia 1 racing scene
gaming,10.63,"Just installed Hades , the first one. What should I expect? Just finished silksong and trying to finish hollow knight."
gaming,13.11,For business use you need the Xbox 360 Copilot X Series X Master Chief Digital edition for Work or School (New).
gaming,10.9,"I can tell you what has one of the worst, despite being  a game I absolutely adore. Abiotic Factor.

Sometimes when you get hurt your character shouts ""STOP IT!"" and it's weirdly disturbing. It's incredibly loud, to the point of peaking the audio track, and it invokes feelings of a helpless person being injured and their only reaction is to desperately yell to stop.

It's like nails on a chalkboard when I hear it, but I only ever hear it in really stressful moments where I'm under attack so it's oddly effective.

So maybe it is one of the best injury sounds in gaming.

  
edit: Found it on youtube. 3:07 is the link doesn't work correctly. [https://youtu.be/dZUWtIOdZQ0?t=187](https://youtu.be/dZUWtIOdZQ0?t=187)"
gaming,13.25,Hell yeah.
gaming,15.99,"Probably Minecraft, i played with my buddy every week for literal years."
gaming,11.79,How is it even close - Doom Marine from Doom 1! ha
gaming,1.88,Can someone ship me one to Canada?
gaming,13.25,There are many arguments against everything you said but I just can't be bothered to argue.
gaming,12.03,Quality bait mate. You sure got these idiots believing this.
gaming,1.55,Vice City. If I close my eyes I still see me leading the cops on a 5 star chase across that bridge on a stolen motorcycle
gaming,1.54,Guy from Super Street Fighter 4.
gaming,2.59,"Got dissapointed with the roguelike elements in the first one. How is this when it comes to new weapons, run and build variations?"
gaming,2.27,Gran Turismo 2 for sure
gaming,0.09,"Unlike the first game, you can’t really ignore your cast in Hades 2. It grabs enemies and keeps them in place, allowing you to reposition through dashing. 

In Hades 1, you would use Zag’s speed to evade danger. In Hades 2, you use agility and positioning. I like that it gives each game a unique feel, but I understand preferring the previous style of movement."
gaming,5.06,FatShark made the engine a decade ago and sold it to Autodesk to make Vermintide. Autodesk then abandoned the engine in 2018 (just as HD2 began development) and it has been held together by spit and chicken wire ever since.
gaming,13.8,Took me about 20 hours in both games to finish my first run and I consider myself a decent gamer. So... Someday...
gaming,0.01,look in the mirror. Are you lying because you hate Nintendo?
gaming,5.44,FSR 3.1 frame gen
gaming,3.46,Witcher 3. Skellige is just too much water.
gaming,5.77,"I believe the grades should be for the quality of the remaster and not for the game itself, extremely lazy remaster"
gaming,4.04,Probably that pinball game on windows xp
gaming,8.36,"Same, I really loved the artwork for FFTA/A2 but the lore was too childish after FFT it was a really let down for me but I appreciate the fact that made the generation after mine enjoy tactical jrpgs so the genre could continue to exists"
gaming,6.49,"I hope it comes to other consoles eventually.

That's where I completed the first one and I'd prefer doing it there with this one."
gaming,3.42,Brilliant thanks! I’ll check it out.
gaming,13.4,"I have too many games to play. I'm still trying to complete the first Hades, Death Stranding 1, Kingdom Come Deliverance 1 before I get to 2025. I still want to 100% Hollow Knight 1. I have probably 10 games I'm in the middle of and like 70+ games on my wishlist."
gaming,11.22,Digimon World 2 probably.
gaming,0.85,"Well it was a mix of that but more so the games really enforced community, team work, organization, just to play the game. They really leaned into the ""alternate living world"" fantasy and everything wasn't game-ified, and lack of social media/internet resources made it so the game was a journey, an exploration with mystery, rumor, secrets, etc."
gaming,10.0,Team Fortress 2
gaming,10.9,roblox
gaming,13.11,"It’s their first true sequel, right?"
gaming,8.71,I was thinking the same thing lol
gaming,7.28,John Darksouls definitely had the best death screech.
gaming,12.47,"Yeah, I found it irritating that the final Homicide case has you wandering around town to destinations based on the killer's riddles, but most of them are places you wouldn't know about unless you'd been randomly exploring the map. You end up waiting for the game to take pity on you and just give you the answer. I really don't think the game would have lost much by excluding the free roam option."
gaming,9.44,"I loved everything except the Judge/Law system. At first, when there was only 1 or so rules, it wasnt bad, because you could just walk between tiles until you got a rule combo that worked for your setup, but eventually the game adds more and it became too much of a chore. Constantly being told what you CANT do, in a video game, is not fun. Completely turned me off. 

I can understand the intended purpose, forcing the player to adapt, but that system just wasnt my thing. I want to adapt to different enemy types/abilities, enemy/environmental mechanics, etc.. But in an RPG, I want to be able to build the sqaud I want to build and not be punished to the extreme for it by an ever-changing set of arbitrary rules. Changing rules daily also isnt 'lawful' at all. Its pure anarchy/chaos."
gaming,1.54,You can just admit you can’t afford a PC or even a Switch which has sold hundreds of millions of units.
gaming,10.22,That’s right lol. Good times
gaming,13.61,"But the point is Cole was *right*. He knew it was something more, and it was. 

He was vindicated in his perfectionism and belligerence. He needed a case to knock him down a peg, make him doubt, but have his skills show through after in Arson."
gaming,1.89,Just use poison and you win every fight
gaming,7.29,Neither are in hades 2.
gaming,1.12,"I know it's your opinion, but this is wrong lol"
gaming,10.67,"It’s probably my favorite roguelike because of how good the story is presented. 

I’m not consistent enough getting past the 3rd zone boss, and when I do get past that, my pass rate of the final few rooms before you can pass Cerberus is even worse."
gaming,1.85,Missions that put you through unskippable sequences with minimal interactivity that just drag on for minutes on end. Fine for first playthroughs but kill any pacing on subsequent runs.
gaming,13.09,"Dark souls 1 male character, definitely the best damage taken noise in gaming."
gaming,9.18,"My first thought was castle mistmoore from EQ. I can’t say why, but I remember it felt like a dangerous place, even if you out leveled it. It also wasn’t huge open areas, more hallways and rooms. Almost like it was designed not with the game in mind, but kind of how they just wanted to make an evil castle. "
gaming,9.09,"Spyro: Year of the Dragon. In the level ""Sheila's Alp"", when you defeat a Rhynoc there, they yodel as they die."
gaming,12.88,"The game im thinking of was like a multiplayer mad max mod. I forget the name of it but it was incredible. The og half life engine was truly a masterpiece. The games made in that were my childhood, earth special forces, master sword, and so many others."
gaming,0.58,"Yeah it depends on the reviews for Yotei. I think the review embargo lifts tomorrow. I've heard good things about DK Bananza but since this year is so stacked, it could miss out on a nomination if Ghost of Yotei is good enough."
gaming,2.78,"Tarkov has one of the most brutal learning curves of any multiplayer game, but I have yet to see someone not absolutely love it (and simultaneously hate how janky it is) once they get the hang of it.

If a company can figure out how to make an extraction game (shooter or otherwise) that is more approachable than Tarkov but achieves it without sacrificing a ton of depth & complexity, I think they'll have an incredible game. Maybe ARC Raiders will be that, but I have my doubts."
gaming,9.99,There was another matrix game I played it was amazing too
gaming,11.14,"I hope they take what the gamers want with a grain of salt. They need to keep the spirit of the game intact. Destiny 2 players kept bitching about everything and look how that game turned out, it’s ass. Watered down, a shell of its former self. Sometimes the loudest voices are a minority of players."
gaming,9.68,Phantasy Star for the SMS for sure.
gaming,11.0,"Dude, if you have the kind of tiktok attention span that can only handle games with super mario level storytelling, you’ll forgive me if i dont think your judgement is the be-all-end-all.

Especially when it literally won best narrative.

If you think the people who are outing themselves as having not played any appreciable way into the game or had time to develop any characters, villains, etc are truly above criticism because you think 10 hours is too long, then youre also outing yourself as having not played it, because the game is full of timed events, quests, sidequests, and 10 hours either means they either skipped everything and didn’t pay attention to the world, or they DID do quests and still didnt make it through the first main dungeon and decided they knew what the game is about."
gaming,5.98,Those are both part of the Extended mod pack!
gaming,9.33,"Good gameplay but I have a *really* hard time for ""kid gets transported to another world""-stories. And it doesn't really fit with the first FFT."
gaming,10.24,Who asked for your opinion?
gaming,4.53,"True! Or the conversation between him and Mimir, about having Atreus teached how to ""woo""."
gaming,6.66,Could be. DK Bananza was a lot of fun for me.
gaming,4.03,"Yeah, I wouldn't expect to make it consistently until you're pretty far along.  
But no doubt, roguelikes aren't for everybody and especially if you're someone who wants to bounce around between games.  
I've been playing roguelikes since the 2000s and almost exclusively play loop-based games with little interest in long-form or narrative games at this point. Hades made an attempt to bridge the gap for sure but IMO you still have to be a roguelike lover for it to be really worth it."
gaming,0.82,"Early on like first 1-2weeks after release I remember getting a 'connection lost"" as I was running somewhere out of town..

Logged back in dead. Paged GM who showed up and gave me 500gold and a full bone armor set. Which was insane as I never even saw bone armor yet. And only had like 50 gold to my name.

Maybe 2 or 3 weeks later on ATL I remember in Britain seeing lord blackthorn logged in on his horse he gave someone a new sword and then he left. Never to be seen in game again.

As a high school kid I also remember in 1998ish finally able to farm a decent amount of gold and starting to sell gold for real life money.. I calculated at the time it was more money then the minimum wage around 6.00 or 7.00/hr.. I could farm gold and ""play"" the game and get paid at the same time. I ended up selling a decent amount .. maybe around 2k dollars in total.. then of course later sold my house, sold my account etc etc."
gaming,7.3,"Sim City probably! An old one but not sure which. Then Cilization, Civ III or IV probably. WoW for sure."
gaming,10.57,"Most likely Chrono Trigger, replaying it over and over for all the endings.  Had to be very close anyway and counting replays I've definitely put way over 100 since then.

gaming,18.83,"Selling custom hardware has a high cost of capital and a lot of risk, projected out over several years. 

The decision, shortly before the Xbox 360 was launched, to increasing its RAM from 256MB to 512MB famously cost Microsoft a billion dollars (2005).

It's possible to spend billions designing and launching the hardware and make nothing over the console cycle. I have no idea how often that happens these days, but it's certainly possible (Wii-U?).

Selling subscriptions is basically what all software companies are trying to do now - as live service has shown, it's hard to do that with individual games but it's possible with gamepass.

Gamepass is mostly just a combination of data crunching, marketing and finance - you have a large base of subscribers and you tell publishers ""we'll pay you 25¢ or $1 for every player who plays your game each week"" and then you charge each player $15 a month and you make a profit on the difference. Microsoft know how many people play practically only one game, and how many jump from game to game when there are new releases. The gamers who are playing only a handful of old games, maybe costing Microsoft $2 a month paid to publishers, subsidise those who who play the latest releases (which might cost Microsoft $5 the first week and then a bit less from week 2 or 3?).

And subscriptions are sticky, meaning that people will keep paying them even when they're not using them. It's fucking insane how it's come to this, but I guess it's a matter of consumer convenience."

That said, hard not to feel like it’s kinda shoehorned like they’re just riding the coattails of Elvis and Complete Unknown and cast a young popular actor as a musician and ‘Jeremy Allen White’ + ‘Springsteen’ is what the wheel landed on. But hopefully the end result rises above that."

Let's say you are the CO of a submarine. Your orders are: ""Things are looking bad. Go to sea. Find, track and follow a Russian missile sub. Rules of engagement are you can fire on the sub if you think they are preparing to or have fired missiles.""

Finding the sub would be incredibly hard. No argument there. If your sub managed to find the other sub, you would have to follow it close enough to detect launch procedures without being detected yourself. Also incredibly difficult

Obviously, your torpedoes would be ready to shoot (never say ""fire"" in a sub) at a second's notice.

Maybe you are close but  the sub you are following gets off one missile before you know exactly where they are. Launching a missile is very loud (google ""SLBM gas generator"" for more info). Once they launch the first missile, they have broadcast to the entire ocean where they are. Torpedoes away -- you stopped any more from being launched."

movies,10.46,Think about how much worse it would've been without him.
movies,8.19,I think it's the fourth fim he's written and directed.
movies,2.26,He teamed up with the Soviets.
movies,9.16,"Yes, but your implication is that Redditors (who are predominantly white) are jumping to support Chris because he’s white. I think that’s insanely stupid of you to say. 

The dude is upper middle class so sure, he’s got more money than a lot of people, but so what? He didn’t build it off his family money or through anything nefarious. He worked his ass off while dealing with religious trauma and I think that’s really impressive.

What a weird thing to get bent out of shape about lol."
movies,13.72,Fall in NYC is such a nice memory.  I moved to L.A. recently and October in L.A. is basically summer.
movies,13.6,They finally remade Death Blow.
movies,13.25,"Because Dorothy plays (or at least should play) a major active role in that scene, including directly interacting with Elphaba. Bending over backwards to keep the camera off of her face through all of that will feel labored."
movies,11.91,I doubt this is going to be the iteration you're looking for with Denis at the helm. It will be assuredly be incredibly well made though so maybe it will still win you over in the end.
movies,8.57,"> One of the most quotable movies of all time.

You haven’t seen tombstone, have you?"
politics,0.94,"Americans… if we don’t change our ways, we’ll become “The Divided States of America”:

•	⁠Democratic Backsliding: Elections still happen, but voting access is deeply restricted in some states. Courts and legislatures are stacked to favor one party. Many people see elections as illegitimate before ballots are even cast. •	⁠Christian Nationalist Dominance: Some states enshrine Christianity as central to lawmaking. Religious minorities, LGBTQ+ people, and secular Americans live with fewer protections, creating “two Americas.” •	⁠Widespread Distrust: Congress remains gridlocked, and federal agencies swing wildly in policy with each election. Citizens trust government, media, and even each other less than ever. •	⁠Localized Political Violence: Militias and extremist groups enforce political and cultural boundaries. Election workers face harassment; community spaces become unsafe for open dialogue. •	⁠Global Decline: Allies no longer look to the U.S. as a model democracy. Rival powers like China or authoritarian blocs shape world norms. America is powerful militarily, but morally adrift. •	⁠Everyday Life: Many Americans retreat into ideological enclaves (both online and in real life). People avoid talking politics at work or with neighbors out of fear. Safety and belonging are conditional on fitting the dominant ideology of where you live."

politics,0.74,Hey spherical is a shape.
politics,3.69,"This is why over history the law and rules were developed to exclude monarchs, priests and tyrants.  We learned that given any chance they will try to subvert the masses for profit and power.

""I join in your reprobation of our merchants, priests and lawyers for their adherence to England & monarchy in preference to their own country and it’s constitution. but merchants have no country. the mere spot they stand on does not constitute so strong an attachment as that from which they draw their gains. in every country and in every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty. he is always in alliance with the Despot abetting his abuses in return for protection to his own. it is easier to acquire wealth and power by this combination than by deserving them: and to effect this they have perverted the purest religion ever preached to man, into mystery & jargon unintelligible to all mankind & therefore the safer engine for their purposes.""

politics,1.11,Trump is the vehicle for them to use to push what they want and probably tell him they’ll make him so powerful and wealthy and he’s doing such a good job.
politics,3.06,"What's shame got to do with it? I just don't like to glorify violence or use it for shock value. You do you, though."
politics,14.13,"I mean yes and no.  It could have been testing grounds to see what they can and cannot do, but if they pull things that elon and others did during the 2024 elections.  That is when you pull the riskier events.  Especially if R wins again.  Instant pardons and investigations dropped."

politics,0.14,It makes more sense when you realise he was blind shooting into an unmarked van.
politics,10.26,No thank you x
politics,11.1,The only common denominator is white shooters I guess lmao. Most logical step is to take guns from white men at this point.
politics,0.9,They agreed to those terms ON THE CONDITION THEY WOULD RECEIVE CITIZENSHIP! I served with a lot of these guys.
politics,4.12,"Yep, getting a lot of comments that don’t see it, but Trump wouldn’t have given his time and energy to him if he wasn’t getting “something” out of it."
politics,6.16,I feel crazy. It was an elevator malfunction. Literally who cares? Why are Trump and his stupid enablers trying to make this an international incident? Any other president would have chuckled at the timing and walked up the escalator.
politics,18.86,"Republicans are pulling this shit *on purpose* to dilute the true meaning of their repulsive and violent behaviors so they can spread their ""BoTh SiDeS!"" lies."
politics,0.14,Yep. Agent Orange will declare martial law and cancel elections. Schumer and Collins will still be furrowing their brows in concern when the secret police come to collect them.

politics,7.62,And who is going to stop him.
politics,9.88,">“Today’s guilty verdict against would-be Trump assassin Ryan Routh illustrates the Department of Justice’s commitment to punishing those who engage in political violence,

Except.... oh a few thousand people who went rampaging through the Capitol intent on pillaging and murdering whomever they could grab."
politics,11.21,"Just some light stochastic terrorism from conservative pundits, nothing out of the ordinary. 🙄

/s in case that wasn't obvious."
politics,4.76,Imagine! Incompetence in the administration.
politics,13.08,"Even if it literally says ""TRUMP was my biggest client"" it's not gonna matter, his supporters will just gobble up some bullshit narrative and the institutions supposed to check the president's power are still filled with conservatives."
politics,6.2,"Sounds like they pulled this out of there asses to cover up that one of their terrorist ice agents killed one and wounded two and are covering it up using the Kirk shooting ammunition BS , blame the left bs for one of their own murdering people"
politics,2.83,Because Republicans want it that way.
politics,12.41,"You motorboatin’ son if a bitch! You old sailor, you!"
politics,4.66,"You realize that multiple candidates from the end of the spectrum can dilute votes of a potential winner, right?"
politics,13.05,"Because it would normally be an open and shut case. But due to their incompetence he can potentially get off which is a symptom of the problem and not the root cause.       

Luigi murdered someone allegedly and there is footage and evidence. But due to the federal administration being ran by a bunch of morons that can’t follow basic instructions they might fumble this case. On top of the fact the ultra powerful want even higher punishments because it was one of them being killed.     

All in all when you have incompetence and celebrate it, small things like this case start to show the crack that will become the gaping hole in this admins downfall."
politics,1.11,Right?! Still. This dude is threatening violence over technical issues?! This timeline is wild! \*stares off into the distance\*
politics,6.73,"Dude is a wealthy white guy from South Africa where his parents owned an emerald mine that utilized slave labor.

I'd be surprised if the guy WEREN'T a white supremacist given his upbringing."
politics,11.75,"From the same admin that claimed a previous detainee had ""MS 13 tattoed on his knuckles"" and provided a doctored photo as ""proof""..

Actions (only killing or wounding detainees) speak louder than words (written on a bullet).

politics,0.23,"I can say whatever I want about him. If I think he’s guilty, I’m free to say it. Court of public opinion."
politics,2.44,You don’t have to be a Trump bootlicker to recognize that there has been a recent increase in left wing violence lately. Obviously in recent history right wing violence has been more common and deadly. But the trend of left wing violence occurring lately is undeniable. And it does nobody any good to deny reality
politics,2.18,How long until the VERY incriminating text messages from right after the shooting are released where the shooter admits everything in a VERY realistic conversation 
politics,5.69,"It's definitely two different situations but fwiw Carr couldn't have done anything about ABC either. He just threatened them mafia-style and they willingly complied, but ultimately if he did anything ABC could have sued. No actual laws or rules were broken and even now no one can even point to the so-called hateful rhetoric in the monologue. ABC could have and should have said, to quote John Oliver, ""fuck you, make me."""
politics,8.24,"Let's be fair, it also existing to kneecap a bunch of agencies who were investigating Musk's businesses"
politics,3.84,"Trump has been impeached, TWICE! 

Impeachment is toothless without a senate trial, conviction and removal from office."

politics,0.04,And?
politics,5.22,"This makes me kind of hopeful. I think the plan was to lay these people off and replace them with loyalists. They were pushing hiring through AFPI to accomplish this. But maybe, just maybe, this means they couldn’t find enough loyalists that actually wanted to do work, so they have to bring back employees instead. I don’t know this for sure at all. Just speculating."

You have recently made your comment history private to hide your history of posting nothing but administration talking points.  Stop this."

If they ever do that, it will be the Dale Gribbles of this world who come out best."
politics,12.08,"Well, for one you’re missing the word “alleged”. Man has been convicted of no crime, and your libel is unwarranted. 

Secondly, for the crime he’s accused of - whomever it was who pulled the trigger that killed wealthcare insurance CEO Brian Whatshisnamehonestlynobodyfuckingcares means that the murderer didn’t get off; he was executed."
politics,0.65,He’s digging his own grave and I’m here for it.
politics,12.18,And are you under the assumption that the police do not do this?
politics,7.72,And he accuses trans people of being violent.
politics,9.73,"Nah, he's already said he hires based on loyalty and nothing else.

And this is the result of that.

There's also a non-zero chance that this was intentional so they could use it to attack the UN.  Team Trump is petty AF, and absolutely would stoop to the level of self-sabotage in order to pin it on someone else."
politics,13.66,be a lot cooler if they did tho
politics,12.47,They will respond by being dismissed during jury selection.
politics,0.18,"At his absolute peak, Donald Trump lacked the intellectual capacity, as well as the attention to detail or even interest, to succeed as POTUS, let alone now, years deep into the late stages of crippling cognitive decline. 


But the totalitarian billionaire cabal that runs the American right wing never needed, or even wanted, someone smart or capable. Grover Norquist himself said that what they really wanted was just an idiot with a pen to sign off on their complete dismantling of the United States of America. And they got it."
politics,13.48,Is he ok?
politics,10.0,"I don't view religion as partisan. Christianity in political policy is definitely a right wing thing, but religion in general is not. Case in point, Jimmy Kimmel's declaration of devoutness to his faith in last night's monologue, or Bernie Sanders offering  'thoughts and prayers' regarding the slain social worker earlier this month"
politics,6.71,"I'm pretty sure I just need to pad my entire office at home at this point in time. 

Banging my head into things is becoming a norm. Then again, I've been a tall person for quite a bit of time in my life; so my head has suffered that type of abuse."
politics,3.4,Maybe you should ask Trump and his friends if you are suddenly so concerned about where taxpayers money go.
politics,3.69,"Ah yes those nefarious illuminati who were able to use their secret neutralizers and cloaking device to sneak by all the security cameras, security people and secret service to push a button on the escalator. 

Pfft  - Call it what you will"

There was no evidence at the time, or even now, that shows this claim to be true. It was a lie. It's amazing to me that you're incapable of just accepting that people on both sides lie, all the time, to advance their agenda."

politics,11.14,Neither are New Yorkers or progressives.
politics,2.44,He fired indiscriminately into the back of an ICE Vehicle. It was early in the morning and thus he likely did not even know they had detainees in the van. Pure incompetence but that’s not surprising. Someone mentally ill enough to do something like this is likely not going to be very competent
politics,6.18,The margins were huge. I’d be more worried about close races.
politics,9.57,"It was literally determined that Trump's own videographer, who was at the top of the stairs, did it. As for the telapropter, from my understanding, it was also run by his own staff. I could be wrong on that last part. Side note, I was under the impression that using a teleprompter was the worst thing ever and was only for mentally declining Presidents. Or so we have been told for the last 4 years."
politics,9.46,Stop importing illegals and to bolster your ballots and those things wouldn’t be necessary. Confirming that the person voting is actually a citizen isn’t voter suppression it’s common sense.

Meanwhile, in countries that have gun control, they *aren't* disappearing immigrants. They *don't* give police forces the budget of a small military and the training of a racist vigilante militia.

politics,8.48,"No offense, and I say no offense since this somehow always offends people (especially Europeans), but the EU really hasn't been much to begin with in the past few decades, especially beyond obvious historical momentum. There's a reason why it always has to be referred to as the EU, even though everyone knows the few key players (e.g., Germany and France) for R&D are what really drives enough to be competitive with the US and China. People imagining some future where European research or tech broadly comes out on top are beyond delusional - if things start to crumble in the US and China in those regards, good luck not seeing Europe get severely affected.

It's an even bigger joke to think somehow the systems are just more resilient - sure, there are numerous political differences that make the kind of abuse that happens in the US improbable in certain parts of Europe, but the sentiment shifts are still possible and just as damaging in aggregate. As an American that grew up in a somewhat rural part of a southern state, and now living in Switzerland while visiting as a researcher and having visited various parts of Europe, I notice the exact same feelings of rural people feeling left behind and lost in Europe that I first noticed in the US. I really don't think the post you're replying to is that far-fetched, though maybe it is far-fetched for rose-spectacled people whose main interest is isolating and salivating at things going wrong elsewhere in the world."
politics,2.68,"*The state superintendent in* [*Oklahoma*](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/oklahoma) *announced plans to put Turning Point USA chapters in every high school in the state, saying it would counter “radical leftist teachers unions” and their “woke indoctrination”.*

What the heck is this?  How can anybody employed in that role get away with saying things like that?"

politics,5.69,"It's been happening at least since Reagan. Kneecap government programs > block programs from doing what they're made for > ""See? This program doesn't work!"" > justify defunding > rinse and repeat until the program is killed entirely. That was literally the play with ACA. GOP wouldn't allow it to go through until it was heavily kneecapped, then they spent years campaigning on how bad it was."
politics,7.24,Right? Kash Patel's nincompoops really went across the street and scribbled on those bullets with the disposable blue pen in their pocket.
politics,19.53,"In my understanding, the point of the ""trinity concept"" is that Christians claimed to be monotheists worshipping only one capital-g God, but then they started also worshiping their martyr Jesus, and some people were like ""WTF, is there only one God, or two?"" And there are also all of these references to the Holy Spirit etc., so maybe 3 gods? So then they got together and tried to work through the apparent contradiction, and the conclusion of that meeting was that Jesus was both different from God, but also the same. Then they could safely worship him without violating the strictures of monotheism. Some other people disagreed about the whole 3-gods-for-the-price-of-1 deal, and the two groups split. In the 2nd–3rd century the 3-in-1 group snuck some new lines into their versions of the bible, and re-interpreted various others, to back up their position.

There is no ""antifa"" as an organization, but to the extent the non-centrist left agrees on anything, the settled-upon language is 100% ""Fuck ICE""."

politics,13.23,"Putting anything on a bullet is ridiculous.  If the shooter was so adamant in his convictions, there wouldn’t have been any unspent shells left, and probably a manifesto describing his thoughts, and intentions.  Instead, we’re getting law enforcement ignoring all precedents and revealing major evidence to the public before a true investigation, and said evidence is scribbled on by a pen to say “anti-ice”?    This whole thing is fucking bullshit.  They’re stoking the fires.  They want civil unrest."

That's the whole point. It is likely wrong, but it has disrupted the single viewpoint that is was ""obviously"" (ie fake-ly) some weird trans leftist. It's a lie/mistake (looks like the dude was an unremarkable center-left online weirdo), and it helped blunt the right wing narrative."

politics,0.19,"No numb nuts.  The real results of two election losses to Trump.  

Also it was during the PRIMARY.  Not the general election.  Ya'll want us to vote with our hearts in the primary.  That's what progressives are told every time.  Don't get mad when people do exactly what you ask.

Also, I would argue she did less than Mamdani.  Mamdani is listening to voters and putting policies that a majority like.  Harris sent fucking Bill Clinton to Michigan to tell people of middle eastern heritage that Israel had to kill Gazans.  Like she threw away a shit ton of votes everywhere in the nation because she wouldn't listen to polls that said most voters wanted to war in Palestine to end.  Like is it unreasonable for voters to be against genocide?  And before you say well Trump is worse I want to point out that just a controlled genocide is still bad."
