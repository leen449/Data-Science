gaming,0.7,"DMC5 has one of the most difficult plats of these two generations, in my opinion.

Catherine has an extremely difficult endgame trophy. I don't remember the exact requirements, but I think it requires you to beat an endgame mode that is procedurally generated and the levels become increasingly more difficult with the last one being absolutely brutal. You have to think REALLY fast and plan several steps ahead while at it to get them done.

Hollow Knight is also pretty difficult, especially if you suck at platformers (like I do). Other platformers, like Celeste and Super Meat Boy, should also be mentioned here. Crash Bandicoot 4 as well, I guess.

I've heard that Crypt of the Necrodancer is very difficult to plat, but haven't tried it myself, so can't comment on that.

Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus requires you to beat the game on the hardest difficulty without dying.

Max Payne 3 was probably the hardest plat I've gotten, but I believe it's actually impossible to do as of now.

I wouldn't look at souls-likes or soulsbourne games for that, because their plats are usually pretty straightforward and not difficult trophy-wise. Gameplay might be hard, but it becomes relatively easy over time.",dmc5 one difficult plats two generations opinion catherine extremely difficult endgame trophy dont remember exact requirements think requires beat endgame mode procedurally generated levels become increasingly difficult last one absolutely brutal think really fast plan several steps ahead get done hollow knight also pretty difficult especially suck platformers like platformers like celeste super meat boy also mentioned crash bandicoot 4 well guess ive heard crypt necrodancer difficult plat havent tried cant comment wolfenstein 2 new colossus requires beat game hardest difficulty without dying max payne 3 probably hardest plat ive gotten believe actually impossible wouldnt look soulslikes soulsbourne games plats usually pretty straightforward difficult trophywise gameplay might hard becomes relatively easy time

How original textures were made. Someone designs them, the software alone to do that is worse. The design is checked and iterated 20 times, 70% of textures for enemies are thrown out as the enemy type is not picked for the final game. AS the game changes through the design process, they change design choices and the textures change again. Shitloads of design, iteration and unused things are done. That's how a game gets made.

This game, they know the texture already, every single choice has been made, zero going down the wrong path or making designs that aren't used are happening. They have the full game, every decision and all they do is take textures and redo them.

A port can use an emulator, which is usually easier because you can then port every game over using an emulator they make because then 95% of the work done to get every title working is done once and can be reused for every game from that platform.

This will take 2% of the effort of making the real game, but they want to charge full price.

gaming,14.9,"I've been doing a replay of the series from 2 onward, and man the leap in mechanical quality from 4 to 5 is insane. Every Far Cry after the first has added gameplay mechanics, but none added so many as 5 and also, 5 was the last time they didn't feel like a mistake. 

Far Cry 5 gave us: 

* Improved ballistics (and some of the best-feelings in any game) 
* Guns for Hire (aka companions in other games) 
* Planes and real helicopters 
* Garages where you can buy and spawn cars, plus the above 
* Alternate ammo types (other than arrows) 
* Meaningfully new enemies (planes, attack choppers, near-zombies, those guys that can call reinforcements, etc) 
* The entire Challenges system for perk points 
* Ambient puzzles for loot (both in prepper stashes and smaller caches) 
* Better map discovery (losing towers, learning of individual locations by saving people) 
* Dynamic roadblocks and more roaming objectivies
* Safes that need tools and time to crack
* Airdrop fast travel 
* Fucking fly fishing

5 is also probably the hardest Far Cry, at least since 3. And that actually adds a lot in a series that wants you to engage with all these systems. Like, why bother setting traps when you can just shoot every enemy? 

I also think 5 put the most effort into a lot of common elements, like outpost design. Any given outpost is generally pretty good, but the *variety* is amazing. It goes from farming warehouses, to lakeside lodges, to mountaintop observatories. And those are meaningfully different to approach. 

And for me at least, 5 did the best job of balancing the tone. Far Cry's always been a little bit silly, and it's also always been about people doing awful things to each other. And I think by leaning into the madness that is America, the ""I don't know whether to laugh or cry"" of the news stories you here, it does a better job of walking that line. Or maybe I'm a little more familiar with the ways of rural America than I am with Nepal or Indonesian island chains, and seeing these places burnt, bloodied, or ready for war, it hits home in a way the others didn't.",ive replay series 2 onward man leap mechanical quality 4 5 insane every far cry first added gameplay mechanics none added many 5 also 5 last time didnt feel like mistake far cry 5 gave us improved ballistics bestfeelings game guns hire aka companions games planes real helicopters garages buy spawn cars plus alternate ammo types arrows meaningfully new enemies planes attack choppers nearzombies guys call reinforcements etc entire challenges system perk points ambient puzzles loot prepper stashes smaller caches better map discovery losing towers learning individual locations saving people dynamic roadblocks roaming objectivies safes need tools time crack airdrop fast travel fucking fly fishing 5 also probably hardest far cry least since 3 actually adds lot series wants engage systems like bother setting traps shoot every enemy also think 5 put effort lot common elements like outpost design given outpost generally pretty good variety amazing goes farming warehouses lakeside lodges mountaintop observatories meaningfully different approach least 5 best job balancing tone far crys always little bit silly also always people awful things think leaning madness america dont know whether laugh cry news stories better job walking line maybe im little familiar ways rural america nepal indonesian island chains seeing places burnt bloodied ready war hits home way others didnt

movies,8.4,"Stories come in two basic modes: comedy and drama. (tragedy I prefer to mean something else)

You can fuse these two basic modes with various genres or you can treat them just based on their own terms. 

Comedy tends to be merged with other genres when it comes to film. The most famous two examples are romcoms and action comedies. If you want to define ""pure"" comedy as comedy without genre elements, then I guess we're going to have talk about things like Bean or Mr Bean's Holiday. 

Drama stands by itself without genre elements to a much greater extent *at first glance*. The reality is that the straight action film is really an action drama, we just don't voice that it's in a dramatic mode because we treat drama as a default. This isn't an inherent condition but it's the current condition.

The fact drama is often treated like a genre rather than a mode is might be why the dramedy exists. You infuse a comedy plot with dramatic conventions and voila, a dramedy. Wikipedia calls such films comedy-dramas.

This is what I think Poehler means by pure comedy. It's films whose only mode is comedy, regardless of genre additions, with no dramatic mode. EEAAO and Birdman are both listed as comedy-dramas on Wikipedia which should obviously make sense. The King's Speech is introduced as an historical drama film and has no references to comedy at all. I think this is a more natural concept for pure comedy than carving out something like Baby's Day Out because it's an ""adventure comedy"" or National Security because it's an action comedy.*

So, where does this leave black comedy? Well, black comedy is just a kind of comedy.

*Mind you, most action comedies tend to exist in a drama mode... normally it's an action movie but with more quips. Or, in the case of EEAAO specifically random as fuck shit just stuck in as visual gags. Some instructive examples might be to compare and contrast Shanghai Noon and Shanghai Knights.",stories come two basic modes comedy drama tragedy prefer mean something else fuse two basic modes various genres treat based terms comedy tends merged genres comes film famous two examples romcoms action comedies want define pure comedy comedy without genre elements guess going talk things like bean mr beans holiday drama stands without genre elements much greater extent first glance reality straight action film really action drama dont voice dramatic mode treat drama default isnt inherent condition current condition fact drama often treated like genre rather mode might dramedy exists infuse comedy plot dramatic conventions voila dramedy wikipedia calls films comedydramas think poehler means pure comedy films whose mode comedy regardless genre additions dramatic mode eeaao birdman listed comedydramas wikipedia obviously make sense kings speech introduced historical drama film references comedy think natural concept pure comedy carving something like babys day adventure comedy national security action comedy leave black comedy well black comedy kind comedy mind action comedies tend exist drama mode normally action movie quips case eeaao specifically random fuck shit stuck visual gags instructive examples might compare contrast shanghai noon shanghai knights

99% of race jokes are stereotypes, aka a form of referential humor. It doesn't matter if the stereotype is actually true or not, it just matters that you know of said stereotype. Many stereotypes are actually statistically false, and many non stereotypes should be stereotypes because of how insanely true they are.

For example, ""white people can't tolerate spicy food"" is a stereotype. It's not true really, whites don't have some sort of genetic intolerance to spice, and some of the most tasteful dishes are from europe, but if I made a joke about that, it's ""funny"" because it references that stereotype.

Now let's take, ""business owner is a white job"". This is not funny, because it's not a stereotype. Business owners may be predominantly white statistically, but if I made a reference to that, nobody is going to laugh.

Telling racist jokes technically has nothing to do with whether or not someone is actually racist, even a someone saying a racist joke in a malicious manner, they could just be saying it to be a dick, and they don't actually believe what they say, and someone joking about it even in a tolerable way can secretly be racist as hell, but knows how to properly mask it off as jokes. And you'd never know, hell the guy telling the jokes probably doesn't even know.

The only way you can be sure someone isn't racist, is if they don't get the joke at all, meaning they don't get the stereotype/never heard of it, meaning it's impossible for them to believe it. But that practically doesn't exist in modern society anymore, with how mainstream race humor has become. Even someone who didn't understand to begin with will now be influenced by the jokes, to the point they might start believing stereotypes, or at least thinking about them.

Now the reason why it's ""funny"" is because it's supposed to be ""offensive"". Race is seen as a taboo topic in society (at least at one point), so making any reference to a possible stereotype is funny because ""you're not supposed to do that"", similar to why potty humor is funny for kids, because usually parents tell the kids that talking about such topics plainly is ""rude"".

This is what separates stereotype from statistic. A statistic that has to do with race, would be more true than any stereotype, but isn't funny because it's not seen as ""taboo"" to talk about that statistic. It's basically dollar store dark humor. People make dark humor jokes for the shock value and because it's ""morally wrong"" to make that joke.

You could argue race humor has devolved into just people finding anything that even mentions race funny, even without the stereotype. For example, someone randomly just saying ""because he's black"" to a non stereotype, but that's a conversation for another day.",youre thinking deep lmao 99 race jokes stereotypes aka form referential humor doesnt matter stereotype actually true matters know said stereotype many stereotypes actually statistically false many non stereotypes stereotypes insanely true example white people cant tolerate spicy food stereotype true really whites dont sort genetic intolerance spice tasteful dishes europe made joke funny references stereotype lets take business owner white job funny stereotype business owners may predominantly white statistically made reference nobody going laugh telling racist jokes technically nothing whether someone actually racist even someone saying racist joke malicious manner could saying dick dont actually believe say someone joking even tolerable way secretly racist hell knows properly mask jokes youd never know hell guy telling jokes probably doesnt even know way sure someone isnt racist dont get joke meaning dont get stereotypenever heard meaning impossible believe practically doesnt exist modern society anymore mainstream race humor become even someone didnt understand begin influenced jokes point might start believing stereotypes least thinking reason funny supposed offensive race seen taboo topic society least one point making reference possible stereotype funny youre supposed similar potty humor funny kids usually parents tell kids talking topics plainly rude separates stereotype statistic statistic race would true stereotype isnt funny seen taboo talk statistic basically dollar store dark humor people make dark humor jokes shock value morally wrong make joke could argue race humor devolved people finding anything even mentions race funny even without stereotype example someone randomly saying hes black non stereotype thats conversation another day

For all Trump’s bluster about a third term and his bitching about mail in voting, I have never been too worried about him cancelling the elections.

Thomas is a possibility, though.

The courts didn’t take Trump’s bullshit last time and they still won’t. It would take a military coup for Trump to stop the elections and that would be a step way over the line for even his sycophants in Congress and the cabinet. They aren’t true believers in Trump, they just want power and money. A coup would burn this country to the ground.

politics,10.7,"The bigger problem is that Democrats are *not* a good answer to the problems the younger generations face at the moment. This trend of young Gen Z men moving a bit to the right is applicable in a *lot* of western countries, but they are usually balanced by a lot of young Gen Z women moving to the left.

The problem is that even Democrats are more concerned with the status quo and corporational wellfare than the Gen Z voter. The job market is getting worse, job prospects are getting worse, finances are stagnating, rents and healthcare prices soaring, family planning is becoming more difficult, climate change sucks. It's all cracking under the weight of corporate welfare so that Meta *and* Zuckerberg can get their 17th tax break this century. Democrats are better than Republicans, but they aren't making the situation better in perceivable, day-to-day ways. Biden was *objectively* better than Trump, but you have to remember he oversaw Covid, which was a shit time alltogether. That perception sticks.

Then as the Democrats come in, they don't actually change all that much. The economy is still working on a nominal level, but the issues Gen Z and Millennials have don't get addressed on a fundamental level. Apparently Trump can break the entire system in 9 months and institute a full-on authoritarian playbook for the rest of his life, but Democrats don't manage a single, big system change that benefits around 40% of the population in their most important, family-starting age for four years.

It's starting to hit a lot of people, especially young men suffering from the loneliness epidemic, and so attitudes are becoming bleaker. In other countries, this swing is *somewhat* balanced by young women and liberal men moving to further left parties while young, disillusioned men vote far-right parties.  But that just doesn't exist in US politics. It is either the far right, or neo-liberalist corporate welfare. ""Left"" doesn't exist the way it does in other countries. Centre and far-right currently make up the spectrum. Just look at how much Schumer and other Democrats are refusing to endorse Mamdani. They *hate* actual left-wing socialism or liberalism. It is corporatism all the way down.

And that system leads to surveys where 25-30% of youngsters say they want a ""strong, authoritarian leader."" They don't actually want a *dictator.* Who they want is someone who can cut through the layers of bullshit and do what Trump does, but that actually makes their life better and makes jobs, makes healthcare affordable and puts housing and family planning in reach.",bigger problem democrats good answer problems younger generations face moment trend young gen z men moving bit right applicable lot western countries usually balanced lot young gen z women moving left problem even democrats concerned status quo corporational wellfare gen z voter job market getting worse job prospects getting worse finances stagnating rents healthcare prices soaring family planning becoming difficult climate change sucks cracking weight corporate welfare meta zuckerberg get 17th tax break century democrats better republicans arent making situation better perceivable daytoday ways biden objectively better trump remember oversaw covid shit time alltogether perception sticks democrats come dont actually change much economy still working nominal level issues gen z millennials dont get addressed fundamental level apparently trump break entire system 9 months institute fullon authoritarian playbook rest life democrats dont manage single big system change benefits around 40 population important familystarting age four years starting hit lot people especially young men suffering loneliness epidemic attitudes becoming bleaker countries swing somewhat balanced young women liberal men moving left parties young disillusioned men vote farright parties doesnt exist us politics either far right neoliberalist corporate welfare left doesnt exist way countries centre farright currently make spectrum look much schumer democrats refusing endorse mamdani hate actual leftwing socialism liberalism corporatism way system leads surveys 2530 youngsters say want strong authoritarian leader dont actually want dictator want someone cut layers bullshit trump actually makes life better makes jobs makes healthcare affordable puts housing family planning reach

Personally I see links between South African apartheid Christian Nationalists, KKK Christianity, Religion as State or a tool of colonial conquest, the German Nazi Parties ""Positive Christianity"" neo-nazi ideology. To me, the Christian nationalism of the CNP, the Family, or the Devos family is more related to the above than traditional mainstream protestantism or Catholicism  in America. Theres even eugenicist who believe in non-religious calvanist predestination being promoted in places like the WAPO and holding conferences. It may just be my experience is from a time when Christian nationalism wasn't something that was talked about and since the 2000s it seems to have become mainstream and is taking over existing churches even though the people pushing Christian nationalism seem very much like White Nationalists. I did notice an odd phenomenon where propaganda from South African Neo-nazis/Christian Nationalists seems to have been being mainstreamed into right-wing media with the attribution to Neo-nazis removed over the last twenty years or so.

There definitely something going on with the CNP and GOP here.

Edit: I have no idea really but I think in the Bush Administration there was a smallish cabal of crusades larping nazis that developed over the course of GWOT and also a handful of lawyer criminals that were key to the bush Administrations use of various crimes against humanity. The lawyer criminals like Ron DeSantis have gone on to become very influential, and in the absence of excusing crimes against humanity, they would have been low performing JAG officers relative to the whole. There is definitely a strain of today's nazi that views crusades larping as a key to power(Hegseth, Flynn Gorka) and may have worked with Russia to continue the Syrian civil war_Yemen for the purposes of driving human migration to areas and doing the whole russian political subversion thing. I was in Paris the night before the attack at the Eagles of death metal concert and I did notice the general situation seemed enflamed in a way that would make the likely of something happening higher, but that was just a personal observation similar to what I observedin Ukraine in 2015. I can't rule out that Iraq was basically motivated by this and corporations like Halliburton profiteering, encircling Iran, and securing oil. Just the money a Halliburton subsidiary made off over charging to provide food at bases in Iraq was pretty significant. All those bush era guys getting together with people like Steven Bannon, finding a figurehead like trump and creating a political mob with unwaverable support in a divided electorate and using usung sine of those intel torture people to sow chaos to use as a ladder via verious operations like qanon and stop the steal would be pretty wild if it did happen. 

I personally think it's weird that the trump family is so involved in housing segregation that there's a woody Guthrie song about. 

One of those two ships in 7th fleet that crashed in trumps first term was diverted from a maintenance period with red-lined navigation equipment to probably the busiest maritime shipping area in the world to back up a mean tweet to Kim Jung Un, I had heard, I think. 

I can't rule out that one of the reasons trump has been ordering weird and reckless military actions since 2017 is that he is an amoral moron using cool sounding raids, erc to get positive feedback from a tv militarism obsessed fan base. Not in this economy.

Just based on personal observation from say 2000 to 2021, I noticed that under the bush administration is they started hiring contractors for military job, massively reducing training in some areas in a way that resulted in a slow loss of institutional knowledge over the years in a way reminesent of how the gop starves the government and then complains things don't work so we should privatize everything of turn it fascist. Just the strain of endless wars had a similar effect on the military over that time. 

I also noticed a similar reliance of mercenary forces that are the American equivalent of the Wagner group over the years. They paid triple canopy(Erik Prince now) to provide parameter security for bases in Iraq especially after a really bad Svied attack on the gate of the base in Ramadi Iraq. These triple canopy shitbags then somehow got a bunch of Ugandan to put in base parameter and internal security guards as human shields possibly in an abusive human labor trafficking type situation. It seems dishonorable generally to use Ugandans as humans shields and they were all generally nice people probably being exploited by dirtbag mercenaries. Triple Canopy has people in the federal protective services within DHS and some betrayed their agencies for doge takeovers. Russell Vought has said he plans to use the military against the American people and bringing mercs in through the poorly regulated DHS federal protective services subcomponent. They have been unquestionably Federal Protective Services agents in the ""ICE"" task force thats been terrorizing everyone. I saw a video where ice agents had been pointing a gun at a guy following them until a guy came over and deescalated and said he was FPS and had an FPS patch/badge on. The same guy was masked and holding up the kind of shield thats used for entering a space or if a shooter is suspected, and he was being a rude clown displaying a totally different demeanor while masked. There could be something like what putin did to secure power in Russia going on. Vought talks about using the military in videos you can find on propublica and democracy now he also mentions ""they failed to pass an amendment"" and I don't know what hes talking about exactly. At least by 2020 I would not have said there was any way the US military as a force would betray the American people for a fascist dictatorship and I still don't. The US military is just microcosm of American society. By the end of trumps term I noticed some of the stupidity Bonhoefler talked about popping up, but much less that in civil society at time. This is why I think Vought is bringing in mercs and also why dhs is quartering on military bases around the country, in my opinion. Also I wouldn't put it past tom Homan to exploit the martyrdom of Charlie Kirk to bring in a trump youth force from the tpusa base. Homan had been attending tpusa events and hyping ice while using a few white nationalist/ dogwhistle and propagandizing peoples kids with violent rhetoric. 

If I had to guess they radicalized a kid into a staged attack in Butler, PA then blew his head and did something similar to bring about the tragic murder of Charlie Kirk.

One thing that stuck out to me after the Butler PA attack was the use of disinformation and spectacle and a distraction with an example being two minutes of hate propaganda focused on the secret service to a audience primed to feel anger, fear, and distrust at women. Same thing after the tragic murder only this time the FBI director and others were a part of the operation. The secret to their success is being totally amoral pieces of shit like the German nazi party.

Elon musk has definitely been part of an effort to incite civil unrest in England.
