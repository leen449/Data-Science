gaming,Dancing_Gavin,263,"DMC5 has one of the most difficult plats of these two generations, in my opinion.

Catherine has an extremely difficult endgame trophy. I don't remember the exact requirements, but I think it requires you to beat an endgame mode that is procedurally generated and the levels become increasingly more difficult with the last one being absolutely brutal. You have to think REALLY fast and plan several steps ahead while at it to get them done.

Hollow Knight is also pretty difficult, especially if you suck at platformers (like I do). Other platformers, like Celeste and Super Meat Boy, should also be mentioned here. Crash Bandicoot 4 as well, I guess.

I've heard that Crypt of the Necrodancer is very difficult to plat, but haven't tried it myself, so can't comment on that.

Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus requires you to beat the game on the hardest difficulty without dying.

Max Payne 3 was probably the hardest plat I've gotten, but I believe it's actually impossible to do as of now.

I wouldn't look at souls-likes or soulsbourne games for that, because their plats are usually pretty straightforward and not difficult trophy-wise. Gameplay might be hard, but it becomes relatively easy over time."

gaming,TwoBionicknees,3613,"hand made... dude, it's much worse than you are saying. 2 games, wow, they should be $5 each.

How original textures were made. Someone designs them, the software alone to do that is worse. The design is checked and iterated 20 times, 70% of textures for enemies are thrown out as the enemy type is not picked for the final game. AS the game changes through the design process, they change design choices and the textures change again. Shitloads of design, iteration and unused things are done. That's how a game gets made.

This game, they know the texture already, every single choice has been made, zero going down the wrong path or making designs that aren't used are happening. They have the full game, every decision and all they do is take textures and redo them.

A port can use an emulator, which is usually easier because you can then port every game over using an emulator they make because then 95% of the work done to get every title working is done once and can be reused for every game from that platform.

This will take 2% of the effort of making the real game, but they want to charge full price.

Not to mention it would build on the lore of the first game, and that lore was not built to last, which would make it more serious, which again, undermines the whole premise.

Primal was actually a smart second move, but they forgot that making it a smaller game is what made the whole exercise more interesting for everyone. Once it's a full game it must meet that level of quality and safeness. Making them small and risky and yes even a bit janky means the dev team can have some fun with it, and players get to experience something refreshing without having to pay for a full game. 

Seeing what the franchise has turned into it feels like a huge missed opportunity. No doubt it would all feel less stale with wilder games now and then, not to mention some of the ideas from those riskier games might have been worth bringing into the mainline."

In turn they put this on the payment processors that they are only allowed to process legal business. So they need to filter.

In order to filter, they put this on the vendor. That they need to have auditable processes to avoid such transactions occur.

This is nothing new, and have worked quite fine. However things have exploded. It's so ""easy"" to make games and spread them on platforms and monetize nowadays. So the burden has increased on the vendor to vet the games they sell. Some will slip through the cracks of course, and be up for a long time. And since most people who come in contact with those illegal games are actively searching for them, they don't get reported. When they eventually get reported, each step in the chain wants some action plan to be formed in order to prevent this in the future.

Eventually this lands on the vendor, who brings the games to the market. They realize that there's no chance that they can audit every update on a game, it would be too expensive.

gaming,GrinningPariah,5456,"I've been doing a replay of the series from 2 onward, and man the leap in mechanical quality from 4 to 5 is insane. Every Far Cry after the first has added gameplay mechanics, but none added so many as 5 and also, 5 was the last time they didn't feel like a mistake. 

Far Cry 5 gave us: 

* Improved ballistics (and some of the best-feelings in any game) 
* Guns for Hire (aka companions in other games) 
* Planes and real helicopters 
* Garages where you can buy and spawn cars, plus the above 
* Alternate ammo types (other than arrows) 
* Meaningfully new enemies (planes, attack choppers, near-zombies, those guys that can call reinforcements, etc) 
* The entire Challenges system for perk points 
* Ambient puzzles for loot (both in prepper stashes and smaller caches) 
* Better map discovery (losing towers, learning of individual locations by saving people) 
* Dynamic roadblocks and more roaming objectivies
* Safes that need tools and time to crack
* Airdrop fast travel 
* Fucking fly fishing

5 is also probably the hardest Far Cry, at least since 3. And that actually adds a lot in a series that wants you to engage with all these systems. Like, why bother setting traps when you can just shoot every enemy? 

I also think 5 put the most effort into a lot of common elements, like outpost design. Any given outpost is generally pretty good, but the *variety* is amazing. It goes from farming warehouses, to lakeside lodges, to mountaintop observatories. And those are meaningfully different to approach. 

And for me at least, 5 did the best job of balancing the tone. Far Cry's always been a little bit silly, and it's also always been about people doing awful things to each other. And I think by leaning into the madness that is America, the ""I don't know whether to laugh or cry"" of the news stories you here, it does a better job of walking that line. Or maybe I'm a little more familiar with the ways of rural America than I am with Nepal or Indonesian island chains, and seeing these places burnt, bloodied, or ready for war, it hits home in a way the others didn't."

gaming,HeavyDT,4339,They want you to buy the new ones so they keep the old ones high. Otherwise the playerbase would be fragmented a lot more and they make the most money by having players play and spend on the latest game. Most gamers just play whatever the newest one is and drop the old games as a result.
gaming,Erfivur,3445,I believe the game-design philosophy they have is that you can make it as hard/realistic as you like. The default options are a middle ground basically… you may still not be able to get what you want but it’s early access. Who knows where it’ll end up.
gaming,steathrazor,518,Because Activision is a garbage company that is greedy as hell
gaming,morpheousmorty,56,And it's just short enough that it doesn't need to try and be serious.
gaming,technokitties,3134,Because Activision knows they can sell anything to cod fans. They could make the game literally fully AI-generated and CoD fans would still buy it.
gaming,usual_suspect82,2552,"Because why not? I mean CoD is known mainly for multiplayer. I don't hear many people talking about their campaigns, so there's little reason to revisit older titles, especially if the main feature was practically removed. It's not hurting them, they're not losing any money keeping it at $60 since those games already sold bazillions of copies and made them money hand over fist, and their current cash cow is raking in plenty, so they're not overly concerned with their older catalogue selling well."

gaming,CatCatFaceFace,12,"3 things that works, same as with Nintendo:

1. Price is high because they still sell and more money = better, if someone buys the game, NICE! if not, so what?  
2. ""brand value"" which means that if they show the previous game drops in price, they think that people are just going to wait for price drop and it keeps the brand ""premium""  
3. To push players into newer titles because due to point 2. if new game and old game are same price, people are going to buy the new game instead

(4. All combined into a whammy combo: they know their value, they known their monopoly on that sector of gaming and they won't care)"
gaming,Exul_strength,2636,"If it was just screen capture, it would be fine. (Next to the fact that there are a lot of other alternatives, like OBS)

But it is supposed to do all possible other things to ""enhance gameplay"".

In general, stuff like a browser with a wiki of the game would be fine. Or a stopwatch that's triggered by manual input or reading out a log file with input the game provides.

But it would be not fine to access information that is supposed to be hidden from the player. Then it could be quickly on the pipeline for a wallhack. (At least from the view of the anti cheat)

The article has a whole section about that this tool could be questionable in context of anti cheat software."

gaming,Gr3yHound40_,186,"I also want to add that older COD games are NOT safe to play on PC. COD WW2 had to do some damage control because it was on gamepass this year, which exposed PC players to RCE exploits being used by hackers to access people's computers. Games like BO3 have a community made patch to make private matches safe to play, but all older COD games are a risk for PC players.

So basically, you're paying either full price, or about $60 for a game and the DLC on sale while it is unsafe to play."
