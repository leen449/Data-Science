For all Trump‚Äôs bluster about a third term and his bitching about mail in voting, I have never been too worried about him cancelling the elections.

Thomas is a possibility, though.

The courts didn‚Äôt take Trump‚Äôs bullshit last time and they still won‚Äôt. It would take a military coup for Trump to stop the elections and that would be a step way over the line for even his sycophants in Congress and the cabinet. They aren‚Äôt true believers in Trump, they just want power and money. A coup would burn this country to the ground. 

There is also a significant possibility Trump doesn‚Äôt survive his term. The man is old and not in the best of shape with some medical issues that seem to be getting worse.

politics,BCMakoto,3914,"The bigger problem is that Democrats are *not* a good answer to the problems the younger generations face at the moment. This trend of young Gen Z men moving a bit to the right is applicable in a *lot* of western countries, but they are usually balanced by a lot of young Gen Z women moving to the left.

The problem is that even Democrats are more concerned with the status quo and corporational wellfare than the Gen Z voter. The job market is getting worse, job prospects are getting worse, finances are stagnating, rents and healthcare prices soaring, family planning is becoming more difficult, climate change sucks. It's all cracking under the weight of corporate welfare so that Meta *and* Zuckerberg can get their 17th tax break this century. Democrats are better than Republicans, but they aren't making the situation better in perceivable, day-to-day ways. Biden was *objectively* better than Trump, but you have to remember he oversaw Covid, which was a shit time alltogether. That perception sticks.

Then as the Democrats come in, they don't actually change all that much. The economy is still working on a nominal level, but the issues Gen Z and Millennials have don't get addressed on a fundamental level. Apparently Trump can break the entire system in 9 months and institute a full-on authoritarian playbook for the rest of his life, but Democrats don't manage a single, big system change that benefits around 40% of the population in their most important, family-starting age for four years.

It's starting to hit a lot of people, especially young men suffering from the loneliness epidemic, and so attitudes are becoming bleaker. In other countries, this swing is *somewhat* balanced by young women and liberal men moving to further left parties while young, disillusioned men vote far-right parties.  But that just doesn't exist in US politics. It is either the far right, or neo-liberalist corporate welfare. ""Left"" doesn't exist the way it does in other countries. Centre and far-right currently make up the spectrum. Just look at how much Schumer and other Democrats are refusing to endorse Mamdani. They *hate* actual left-wing socialism or liberalism. It is corporatism all the way down.

And that system leads to surveys where 25-30% of youngsters say they want a ""strong, authoritarian leader."" They don't actually want a *dictator.* Who they want is someone who can cut through the layers of bullshit and do what Trump does, but that actually makes their life better and makes jobs, makes healthcare affordable and puts housing and family planning in reach."

Nobody is forcing anybody to stay where they are. I myself lived in section 8 housing when I moved from my shitty rural town to the city. I lived there for years while I progressed in my career and was finally able to afford a place that wasn‚Äôt being subsidized. I‚Äôm grateful that the option existed and that I was able to utilize it. The opportunities I had in that city changed the trajectory of my life. It wasn‚Äôt always easy ‚Äî those first few years were a serious exercise in budgeting and planning, but it worked out.

The thing of it is, you can be poor in your shitty little town with no real economic opportunities around, or you can be poor in a city where opportunity actually exists. After I got done feeling sorry for where I was in life I made my choice.

This is referencing White people who identify as moderate or left-leaning and claim to want justice and equality for POC but never fail to find a way to turn around and support the oppressors of POC and/or directly or indirectly throw POC under the bus.

Gavin Newsom, for example, took no time at all to sanewash Charlie Kirk as a good-faith debater and profess admiration for him.

It is predominantly White people who are asking POC and other marginalized groups that Charlie Kirk denigrated to feel empathetic or sympathetic about his death.

It is predominantly White people who insist that violence is not an answer to oppression when, by necessity, violence is the way that oppressed people have historically won their rights and freedoms.

And now, once again Democrats didn't have enough backbone to say, we won't do the bare minimum to show support for POC and other marginalized groups by *not* voting for this bill that uplifts an avowed bigot and gives his supporters something to cheer for, all in the name of supposed good-will that Republicans do not and will not show to those that they oppose.

Personally I see links between South African apartheid Christian Nationalists, KKK Christianity, Religion as State or a tool of colonial conquest, the German Nazi Parties ""Positive Christianity"" neo-nazi ideology. To me, the Christian nationalism of the CNP, the Family, or the Devos family is more related to the above than traditional mainstream protestantism or Catholicism  in America. Theres even eugenicist who believe in non-religious calvanist predestination being promoted in places like the WAPO and holding conferences. It may just be my experience is from a time when Christian nationalism wasn't something that was talked about and since the 2000s it seems to have become mainstream and is taking over existing churches even though the people pushing Christian nationalism seem very much like White Nationalists. I did notice an odd phenomenon where propaganda from South African Neo-nazis/Christian Nationalists seems to have been being mainstreamed into right-wing media with the attribution to Neo-nazis removed over the last twenty years or so.

There definitely something going on with the CNP and GOP here.

Edit: I have no idea really but I think in the Bush Administration there was a smallish cabal of crusades larping nazis that developed over the course of GWOT and also a handful of lawyer criminals that were key to the bush Administrations use of various crimes against humanity. The lawyer criminals like Ron DeSantis have gone on to become very influential, and in the absence of excusing crimes against humanity, they would have been low performing JAG officers relative to the whole. There is definitely a strain of today's nazi that views crusades larping as a key to power(Hegseth, Flynn Gorka) and may have worked with Russia to continue the Syrian civil war_Yemen for the purposes of driving human migration to areas and doing the whole russian political subversion thing. I was in Paris the night before the attack at the Eagles of death metal concert and I did notice the general situation seemed enflamed in a way that would make the likely of something happening higher, but that was just a personal observation similar to what I observedin Ukraine in 2015. I can't rule out that Iraq was basically motivated by this and corporations like Halliburton profiteering, encircling Iran, and securing oil. Just the money a Halliburton subsidiary made off over charging to provide food at bases in Iraq was pretty significant. All those bush era guys getting together with people like Steven Bannon, finding a figurehead like trump and creating a political mob with unwaverable support in a divided electorate and using usung sine of those intel torture people to sow chaos to use as a ladder via verious operations like qanon and stop the steal would be pretty wild if it did happen. 

I personally think it's weird that the trump family is so involved in housing segregation that there's a woody Guthrie song about. 

One of those two ships in 7th fleet that crashed in trumps first term was diverted from a maintenance period with red-lined navigation equipment to probably the busiest maritime shipping area in the world to back up a mean tweet to Kim Jung Un, I had heard, I think. 

I can't rule out that one of the reasons trump has been ordering weird and reckless military actions since 2017 is that he is an amoral moron using cool sounding raids, erc to get positive feedback from a tv militarism obsessed fan base. Not in this economy.

Just based on personal observation from say 2000 to 2021, I noticed that under the bush administration is they started hiring contractors for military job, massively reducing training in some areas in a way that resulted in a slow loss of institutional knowledge over the years in a way reminesent of how the gop starves the government and then complains things don't work so we should privatize everything of turn it fascist. Just the strain of endless wars had a similar effect on the military over that time. 

I also noticed a similar reliance of mercenary forces that are the American equivalent of the Wagner group over the years. They paid triple canopy(Erik Prince now) to provide parameter security for bases in Iraq especially after a really bad Svied attack on the gate of the base in Ramadi Iraq. These triple canopy shitbags then somehow got a bunch of Ugandan to put in base parameter and internal security guards as human shields possibly in an abusive human labor trafficking type situation. It seems dishonorable generally to use Ugandans as humans shields and they were all generally nice people probably being exploited by dirtbag mercenaries. Triple Canopy has people in the federal protective services within DHS and some betrayed their agencies for doge takeovers. Russell Vought has said he plans to use the military against the American people and bringing mercs in through the poorly regulated DHS federal protective services subcomponent. They have been unquestionably Federal Protective Services agents in the ""ICE"" task force thats been terrorizing everyone. I saw a video where ice agents had been pointing a gun at a guy following them until a guy came over and deescalated and said he was FPS and had an FPS patch/badge on. The same guy was masked and holding up the kind of shield thats used for entering a space or if a shooter is suspected, and he was being a rude clown displaying a totally different demeanor while masked. There could be something like what putin did to secure power in Russia going on. Vought talks about using the military in videos you can find on propublica and democracy now he also mentions ""they failed to pass an amendment"" and I don't know what hes talking about exactly. At least by 2020 I would not have said there was any way the US military as a force would betray the American people for a fascist dictatorship and I still don't. The US military is just microcosm of American society. By the end of trumps term I noticed some of the stupidity Bonhoefler talked about popping up, but much less that in civil society at time. This is why I think Vought is bringing in mercs and also why dhs is quartering on military bases around the country, in my opinion. Also I wouldn't put it past tom Homan to exploit the martyrdom of Charlie Kirk to bring in a trump youth force from the tpusa base. Homan had been attending tpusa events and hyping ice while using a few white nationalist/ dogwhistle and propagandizing peoples kids with violent rhetoric. 

If I had to guess they radicalized a kid into a staged attack in Butler, PA then blew his head and did something similar to bring about the tragic murder of Charlie Kirk.

One thing that stuck out to me after the Butler PA attack was the use of disinformation and spectacle and a distraction with an example being two minutes of hate propaganda focused on the secret service to a audience primed to feel anger, fear, and distrust at women. Same thing after the tragic murder only this time the FBI director and others were a part of the operation. The secret to their success is being totally amoral pieces of shit like the German nazi party.
