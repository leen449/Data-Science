# âš™ Project Overview
With the growth of online communities, itâ€™s important to explore factors behind toxic vs. non-toxic comments.
This project analyzes Reddit comments, focusing on toxicity detection, account age (in years), and subreddit patterns to uncover what drives negative interactions.

# ðŸ’ŽObjectives

We aimed to answer the following key questions:
	â€¢	Do toxic comments appear more in certain subreddits?
	â€¢	Are older accounts less likely to post toxic comments?
	â€¢	What words are most linked to toxic behavior?
	â€¢	How balanced is the dataset between toxic and non-toxic comments?
