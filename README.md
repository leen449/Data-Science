## âš™ Project Overview
This digital forensics project investigates a hypothesis in social media : the relation of an account age to the offense level visible on the internet.

We utilize the Reddit API to collect large-scale data on accounts engaged in known malicious activities (e.g., spam, ban evasion, misinformation, vote manipulation, astroturfing). By analyzing the creation dates of these accounts and mapping them against their first offensive action, we build a temporal model of malicious account lifecycle.

The core objective is to identify distinct "offense-level" profiles based on account age. This allows for the development of predictive risk models that can help moderators and automated systems flag potentially malicious actors before they cause significant harm, moving security from a reactive to a proactive stance.
